<OverviewBox title="Get a quick overview of Tezos and blockchain technology" imgSrc="/img/Communication.png" floating="true">

This chapter deals with the in and outs of blockchain technology and gives a first introduction to Tezos. This open-source blockchain protocol can execute peer-to-peer transactions and deploy smart contracts.

We will talk about P2P networks and the Tezos P2P layer, as well as the origins and fundamentals of blockchain technology, like smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, hash functions, and deployment patterns. Let's discover how Tezos fits in the overall development of blockchain technology!

We will dive into:

* How Tezos tackles the management problem of public blockchains,
* How change and evolution are possible with the on-chain governance process, and
* How smart contract development becomes safer with Tezos.
