<OverviewBox title="A Rolling Simple Agreement for Future Equity with Tezos" imgSrc="/img/Communication.png" floating="true">

Decentralised Finance (DeFi) brings new and innovative financial mechanisms. After the bubble bursts of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and the upcoming of security token offerings (STOs), programmable equity offerings are becoming more popular.

Blockchain-based programmable equity offerings, such as Rolling Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE), present a financial mechanism focused on future revenues of a company. 
The tokens issued represent a claim on future equity of a company. The **issuing company** receives low-cost liquidity to finance its operations while maintaining control and ownership. 
**Investors** get access to new markets, investments with accessible risk and fixed dilution, and fixed target equity percentage allocations.

The token issuance, cashflow management from the offering, and price calculation are all determined by a smart contract and computed.

### The project

As part of our engagement in Tezos, B9lab has developed a **sample project application** of a Rolling SAFE. It showcases an implementation of a full platform interacting with Tezos and its ecosystem stack, and illustrates how to address challenges, which are natural when one moves from a simple local proof-of-concept implementation to a public online platform.

This project is a great resource to dive into a functioning sample application of a real use case, a Rolling SAFE.

There is **no real investment or company** involved. All transactions are performed on the **Granada Testnet with testnet Tezos**. 
The tokens acquired cannot be traded on secondary markets and do not represent a real claim/value.

In this chapter, we will dive deep into the different elements of developing a Rolling SAFE on Tezos.

In the next sections, you can discover:

* An explanation of what a Rolling SAFE is and how it came into being;
* How core functions can be implemented in a smart contract;
* Building a platform for the offering;
* All on testing when it comes to such an offering.
