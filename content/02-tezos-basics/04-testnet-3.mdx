So far we have used the testnet script to execute **tezos-client** commands. This client communicates with the **tezos-node**.

Communication works with the help of the **JSON/RPC interface**. The **tezos-node** responses are **JSON** based. Notice it is not the **JSON-RPC** protocol, the communication is done over **HTTP** protocol.

Let's first list what the RPC offers:

```
$ ./florencenet.sh client rpc list
```

This should list you the `GET/POST` queries you can do. 

Analogous to the previous section we want to get the balance first.

First, we need to see all the addresses in our wallet:

```
$ ./florencenet.sh client list known addresses
```

Look for `myFirstKey` from the last section and use its address to get the balance, replace the `MYFIRSTKEY_ADDRESS` string in the following command with it:

```
$ ./florencenet.sh client rpc get /chains/main/blocks/head/context/contracts/MYFIRSTKEY_ADDRESS/balance
```

Now you should see the balance. But where is the JSON we are talking about? Let's add a flag and use the command again:

```
$ ./florencenet.sh client -l rpc get /chains/main/blocks/head/context/contracts/MYFIRSTKEY_ADDRESS/balance
```

This time you should see the HTTP requests and the JSON responses the client does.

You can find the reference for the JSON/RPC interface at the [Tezos Developer Resource Documentation](https://tezos.gitlab.io/api/rpc.html).

We can use the flag `-l` for all commands from previous section. So, if you run the command:

```
$ ./florencenet.sh client transfer 1 from faucetWallet to myFirstKey --burn-cap 0.5
```

from last section, you will see all the queries and responses traveling in the background. 

We can also use `curl` for a request 
if you start the network and with an exposed RPC port:

```
./florencenet.sh start --rpc-port 8732
```

Let's request the balance again:

```
curl -s localhost:8732/chains/main/blocks/head/context/contracts/MYFIRSTKEY_ADDRESS/balance
```

We could continue endlessly listing how different requests and their responses look. For the interested reader, we recommend checking out the [full description](https://tezos.gitlab.io/007/rpc.html).
