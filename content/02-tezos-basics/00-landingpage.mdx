<OverviewBox title="Looking for an overview introduction into more Tezos specifics?" imgSrc="/img/Feature_9-01.png" floating="true">

In this chapter, we take a closer look at Tezos’ architecture and start working with the testnet. Let’s tackle the different conceptual elements of the protocol, like the role of nodes, clients, bakers, and endorsers, to then take our first steps in the testnet. Getting to know the design in greater detail and going through some first steps will help being more accustomed to the protocol and its functionalities.
