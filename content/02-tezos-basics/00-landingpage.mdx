<OverviewBox title="Looking for an overview introduction into more Tezos specifics?" imgSrc="/placeholder-image.png" floating="true">

In this chapter, we take a closer look at Tezos’ architecture and working with the testnet. Let’s tackle the different conceptual elements of the protocol, like the role of nodes, clients, bakers, and endorsers, to then take our first steps in the testnet.

We will address:
* How to participate in the the Tezos network,
* How smart contract are written in Tezos and deploy a first repeater contract,
* How to communicate with Tezos using the JSON/RPC interface.
