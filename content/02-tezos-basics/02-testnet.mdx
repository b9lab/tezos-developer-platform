It is now time to participate in a Tezos network.

There are currently three Tezos networks:

- [Mainnet](https://tzstats.com/), has been live and open since 30 June 2018,
- [Delphinet](https://delphi.tzstats.com/), a test network that runs the same protocol as the mainnet, and
- [Edonet](https://edo.tzstats.com/), a cutting-edge development network that runs most recent proposed protocol.

The **Mainnet** is the main Tezos blockchain, where Tezos tokens (tez) have real value - so play with it only when you are confident in what you are doing. 

The easiest way to maintain a Tezos node is to use the docker images that are generated from the [Tezos repository](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/tree/master) on GitLab. They are published on DockerHub and the repository offers a script called `tezos-docker-manager.sh`, which can pull the necessary images and start a Docker Compose network. 

<HighlightBox type="tip">

We just need to rename the script into <code>mainnet.sh</code> if we want to participate on the mainnet. After all, the program name called from the Terminal is the first parameter passed to the process. ;) 

</HighlightBox>

### Docker

Docker offers so-called "software containers" to execute applications. "Container" is a similar concept to that of virtual machines (VM) and uses **libcontainer**. The isolation level is not as strong as with a VM because Docker containers share the host OS kernel. On the other hand, containers are lighter in weight (Storage, RAM and CPU) and faster in execution compared to a VM.

**Dockerfiles** are blueprints for creating **Docker Images**, which are used to start **containers**. You can find public images on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). 

<HighlightBox type="tip">

If you use Windows on your host, we strongly recommend you use a VM to first establish a workspace based on Ubuntu Linux.

## First steps

We will begin our Tezos development on the Edonet. 

<HighlightBox type="info">

Make sure you have installed [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)!

</HighlightBox>

First, we are going to download the Edonet script, make it executable, and run it. Open a terminal (when you see a `$` it means it is a terminal command, do not paste the `$`) and paste the following commands:

```sh
$ wget -O edonet.sh https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/raw/latest-release/scripts/tezos-docker-manager.sh
$ chmod +x edonet.sh
$ ./edonet.sh start --rpc-port 8732
```
As the script spins up Docker images, it first needs to download them, and this may take some time. When the images are on your machine, it will start 7 containers. You can inspect them with:

```sh
$ docker ps
```
You should now see something similar to:

![List of Docker containers](images/edonet.png)

<HighlightBox type="tip">

You can find each component's description in the previous section, **Tezos Architecture** and list supported protocols with `./edonet.sh client list understood protocols`. Notice, only one protocol is activated at any given time. 

</HighlightBox>

From time to time, the `tezos-docker-manager.sh` script will be updated, and, when you want the latest version, instead of downloading it again with the wget command, you can enter:

```sh
$ ./edonet.sh update_script
```

or 

```sh
$ ./edonet.sh restart
```

which will stop the network, update the script, and start the network again. In case you want to disable automatic update when restarting, you can use:

```sh
$ export TEZOS_ALPHANET_DO_NOT_PULL=yes
```

<HighlightBox type="warning">

When the script is being updated, you may again need the command `chmod +x alphanet.sh` to make it executable.

</HighlightBox>

Wait a few minutes for the node container to start synchronising with the alphanet and then check its logs with:

```sh
$ docker logs edonet_node_1 --follow
```
You should be able to see how it syncs up. To stop the endless logs, press <kbd>CTRL-C</kbd>.

Any command starting with `./edonet.sh client` will behave as a **tezos-client**. So, this will be our way to interact with the **node** container we started.

You can get a list of the commands with:

```sh
$ ./edonet.sh client man
```
<HighlightBox type="tip">

You can find the reference for the client commands in the [client manual](https://tezos.gitlab.io/shell/cli-commands.html) of the Tezos Developer Documentation.

## First private key

Before you can send anything on this network, you will need a public-private key pair. Let's take a closer look at the cryptographic concept of public and private keys.

Public/private keys always come in pairs and offer various capabilities. Those capabilities are based on cryptographic mathematics. As their name suggest, the public key is meant to be distributed to whoever is relevant, while the private key is to be jealously guarded, akin to having your house address public, but keeping the key to your house private.

#### Encrypt and decrypt

Alice wants to send a message to Bob, and for Bob's eyes only:

* Bob gives Alice his public key
* Alice uses Bob's public key to encrypt the message
* Alice sends Bob the encrypted message
* Bob decrypts the message with his private key

![](images/keys-001.png)

#### Sign and verify

Alice wants to make sure that Bob's public announcement is indeed from Bob:

* Bob gives Alice his public key
* Bob signs his announcement with his private key
* Bob sends Alice his announcement and its signature
* Alice verifies the signature with Bob's public key

![](images/keys-002.png)

### Key management, PKI

If you look again at the Alice and Bob examples, you will notice that there is a vulnerability in "Bob gives Alice his public key". A malicious Charlie could intercept Bob's public key and pass on his own public key to Alice.

Key management and public key infrastructure (PKI) is an important aspect of cryptography that helps mitigate this risk.

<ExpansionPanel title="RSA">

RSA(Rives, Shamir, Adleman) is a public-key cryptosystem that was first published in 1977. The premise is that if you have a public key ```$$(pubKey,n)$$``` and a private key ```$$priKey$$``` then you can do the following operations on very large numbers:

* encrypt a message:

`$$message ^ {pubKey} \equiv encMessage \mod n$$`

* decrypt the encrypted message:

`$$encMessage ^ {priKey} \equiv message \mod n$$`

Of course, you need to have `$n$` large enough so as not to destroy the `$message$`'s information. Notice also that to encrypt, you need to know both `$pubKey$` and `$n$`, that is the pair that needs to be public knowledge. The `$priKey$`, as ever, is to be protected.

If you want to express that in terms of a theorem, you would say that:

> there exists a triplet `$(priKey, pubKey, n)$` such that for any `$message$`, we get `$(message ^ {pubKey}) ^ {priKey} \equiv message \mod n$`, with the additional hurdle that calculating `$priKey$` out of `$(pubKey, n)$` is computationally expensive and in practice impossible.

Let us work out in detail how you create such a triplet.

**How**

How can we calculate such a triplet of `$(pubKey, n)$` and `$priKey$`? Of course, the difficulty and the art was in finding the following solution, and proving it satisfies the theorem above. Let us dive right in.

* First we choose two prime numbers `$p$` and `$q$`. Then we calculate `n` as their product: `$n = p \cdot q$`.
* Second, we calculate [Euler's totient function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function) `$\phi(n)$`. Unfortunately, calculating `$\phi$` in general terms is an NP problem. Fortunately, and this is no accident, if and only if `p` and `q` are prime numbers, then, it turns out that `$$\phi(n) = (p - 1) \cdot (q - 1)$$` .
* Now we can use a random `$pubKey$`, that satisfies the following 2 conditions:
    * it is [coprime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers) with `$\phi(n)$`
    * it is smaller than `$\phi(n)$`.
* From there, calculating the `$priKey$` means calculating a `$priKey$` that satisfies the following equation:

`$$a \cdot \phi(n) + priKey \cdot pubKey = 1$$`

where we can use the [extended euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm) to get `$priKey$`. You will notice that in this algorithm the part on the right: `$= 1$` is actually `$= gcd(phi(n), pubKey)$`. [gcd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) is the greatest common divisor.

Now we can delete `$p$`, `$q$` and `$\phi(n)$`. And delete them we must, as they could otherwise be used to crack the private key.

**Example**

Let us have a look at an example. 

* We pick `$p = 2399$` and `$q = 26371$`, which are prime numbers large enough for our demonstration. From them, we deduce that `$n = 63264029$` and `$\phi(n) = 63235260$`.
* Now, we have to pick a `$pubKey < \phi(n)$` and not a divisor of it. Let us pick `$pubKey = 54833$`.
* With the help of the [Python implementation](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Algorithm_Implementation/Mathematics/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm) of the extended euclidean algorithm, we pass `xgcd(63235260, 54833)`. It returns us a triplet. We only care about the last element of it, i.e. `$priKey = 6589577$`.

```python
$ python
Python 2.7.15 (default, Dec 13 2018, 23:06:29)

>>> def xgcd(a, b):
...     """return (g, x, y) such that a*x + b*y = g = gcd(a, b)"""
...     x0, x1, y0, y1 = 0, 1, 1, 0
...     while a != 0:
...         q, b, a = b // a, a, b % a
...         y0, y1 = y1, y0 - q * y1
...         x0, x1 = x1, x0 - q * x1
...     return b, x0, y0
... 
>>> xgcd(63235260, 54833)
(1, -5714, 6589577)
```

Now we forget about `$p$`, `$q$` and `$\phi(n)$`. Time to put this effort to good use. Let us encrypt the `$message = 9874587$`. Yes, any digital message is essentially a large number. Notice that we took a message that is smaller than `$n$`. That is by design, otherwise we would lose information. We calculate:

`$$9874587 ^ {54833} \equiv 36898107 \mod 63264029$$`

Our encrypted message is thus `$36898107$`. 

You also happen to know the `$priKey$`, so let us decrypt this right away. We calculate the message back:
`$$36898107 ^ {6589577} \equiv 9874587 \mod 63264029$$`

Yes, our message is, and was, `$9874587$`.

**Why it works**

Let us first introduce Fermat's little theorem. It states that if `$p$` is a prime number then for any number `$a$`, we have `$$a ^ p \equiv a \mod p$$`. If `$a$` is not a multiple of `$p$`, then it can be rewritten as `$$a ^ {p - 1} \equiv 1 \mod p$$`. Our proof will use that knowledge later on.

Let us rework what we have:

`$a \cdot \phi(n) + priKey \cdot pubKey = 1$` means that:

`$$priKey \cdot pubKey \equiv 1 \mod \phi(n)$$`

So `$priKey \cdot pubKey - 1$` is a multiple of `$\phi(n)$`.

But you will recall that `$\phi(n)$` is itself a product of `$p - 1$` and `$q - 1$`. It follows that `$priKey \cdot pubKey - 1$` is a multiple of `$p - 1$` and is also a mutiple of `$q - 1$`. For our purposes, and to express these multiples, we will introduce `$h$` and `$k$` such that:

`$$priKey \cdot pubKey - 1 = h \cdot (p - 1) = k \cdot (q - 1)$$`

With this, let us hop on what we want to prove, encryption followed by decryption works. Let us do just that:

`$$(message ^ {pubKey}) ^ {priKey}$$`

Which, we remember from our algebra classes can be rewritten as:

`$$message ^ {pubKey \cdot priKey}$$`

Which, again, can be rewritten as:

`$$message \cdot message ^ {pubKey \cdot priKey - 1}$$`

Oh we now recognise this thing we had a few lines above. Let us replace and rewrite as:

`$$message \cdot message ^ {h \cdot (p - 1)}$$`

And algebra class helping out, can be rewritten as:

`$$message \cdot (message ^ {p - 1}) ^ {h}$$`

It looks awfully like something we saw in Fermat's little theorem. Let us first suppose that `$message$` is a multiple of `$p$`, i.e. that `$message \equiv 0 \mod p$`. In that case we can say that `$$message ^ {p \cdot q} \equiv message \mod p$$`. 

In other cases, thanks to Fermat's, we have `$message \cdot (message ^ {p -1 }) ^ {h} \equiv message \cdot 1 ^ {h} \equiv message \mod p$`

Now, we can do the same steps but this time with `$k$` and `$q$` in mind: `$message \cdot (message ^ {q -1 }) ^ {k} \equiv message \cdot 1 ^ {k} \equiv message \mod q$`

Let us remember that `$p$` and `$q$` are prime. So for a number to be a multiple of both, it has to be a multiple of their product `$p \cdot q = n$`.

So by mixing these 2 paths, we end up with, `$$(message ^ {pubKey}) ^ {priKey} \equiv message \mod {p \cdot q} \equiv message \mod n$$`. This is what we set out to demonstrate about why RSA works.

Now that we dived into the basics relating to public key cryptosystems, let's do something basic and **create a new key pair**, which our local node will know as `myFirstKey`:

```sh
$ ./edonet.sh client gen keys "myFirstKey"
```
Now let us take a look at the balance of the test account we just created:

```sh
$ ./edonet.sh client get balance for myFirstKey
Warning:
  
                 This is NOT the Tezos Mainnet.
  
          Do NOT use your fundraiser keys on this network.

0 ꜩ
```
Zero tez! There is no free lunch. Because we do not even have any tez, we cannot pay gas for a transfer or a smart contract operation and there is not much we can do with this account right now.

## Adding Testnet Tez (XTZ)

Let us get some Edonet tez to work with! The easiest way to get some _Edonet_ tez is through the [faucet](https://faucet.tzalpha.net/). It will not only give you free tez but also give you a brand new wallet (public-private key pair) on the Edonet, which you will have to copy into your node container.

<HighlightBox type="info">

Yes, the faucet website created a private key for you and you had to download it. This means that someone, somewhere, could have a copy of your private key. That would not be safe **if we were using tez on the mainnet**. But we are using the Edonet, so we will let it slide this time.

</HighlightBox>

Let us say the file you got is `tz1Z47xv2h6GnFvuUUbBz3qTgoNqmiRxZNm1.json`. 

How does the content of this file look?

```
{
  "mnemonic": [
    "hollow",
    "fruit",
    "ticket",
    "yellow",
    "flush",
    "mule",
    "wrap",
    "used",
    "sound",
    "about",
    "flavor",
    "embody",
    "carry",
    "car",
    "estate"
  ],
  "secret": "caaf49e039da94487321601b2eb1301db959831f",
  "amount": "12710245904",
  "pkh": "tz1Z47xv2h6GnFvuUUbBz3qTgoNqmiRxZNm1",
  "password": "Ww4fHJlnQS",
  "email": "dtubyufk.vxacwchy@tezos.example.org"
}
```

In it, all seed words, or "secrets", are contained, which we need to create the private key for the public key hash `tz1Z47xv2h6GnFvuUUbBz3qTgoNqmiRxZNm1`. At a later point in time, we will see how this works when we write a client. As long as we use the **tezos-client**, we do not need to take care of it.

In a terminal, go to the folder where the file is, and run:

```sh
$ docker exec edonet_node_1 whoami                              
tezos
# Just confirming what is the default user

$ docker exec edonet_node_1 id -g -n tezos
nogroup
# Just confirming the group of the default user

$ docker cp tz1Z47xv2h6GnFvuUUbBz3qTgoNqmiRxZNm1.json edonet_node_1:/home/tezos/

# Assigning the account to the tezos account
$ docker exec edonet_node_1 sudo chown tezos:nogroup /home/tezos/tz1Z47xv2h6GnFvuUUbBz3qTgoNqmiRxZNm1.json
```
Then activate an account with this wallet:

```sh
$ ./edonet.sh client activate account faucetWallet with /home/tezos/tz1Z47xv2h6GnFvuUUbBz3qTgoNqmiRxZNm1.json
Node is bootstrapped.

```

<HighlightBox type="tip">

If you want to deploy a contract with this account, make sure your node is sync'ed up. You can check if the node is sync'ed up with `./edonet.sh client bootstrapped`.

</HighlightBox>

We said that there is a chance that this `faucetWallet` may be compromised, so it is within the realm of the reasonable to _protect_ our tez in a local-only wallet. Let us do that and transfer some tez from `faucetWallet` to our `myFirstKey` account:

```sh
$ ./edonet.sh client transfer 1 from faucetWallet to myFirstKey --burn-cap 0.5
```

After your transaction has been included in a block, your `myFirstKey` account should have received 1 tez, which you can check again with:

```sh
$ ./edonet.sh client get balance for myFirstKey
1 ꜩ
```

# Writing smart contracts on Tezos

## Michelson

In Tezos, the machine code for smart contracts, the equivalent of assembly, is called [Michelson](https://tezos.gitlab.io/007/michelson.html) and warrants many sections in its own right. For now, we will be content knowing that, similarly to the JVM or the Ethereum VM, it is stack-based. Unlike the EVM, though, which treats any element on its stack differently depending on what the next opcode is, in Michelson, each opcode is strongly typed.

<HighlightBox type="info">

Later on, we will extensively address and work with Michelson. In this moment, our main focus is to introduce Michelson so that we can deploy a contract with the **tezos-client**.

</HighlightBox>

### Strongly typed

Any assembler is commonly able to check that the stack has the right number of operands for each of its opcodes. Thanks to its strong typing, the Michelson assembler goes further and can type-check each low-level opcode before sending the compiled contract across the network. The "output(s)" of an opcode must match the "input(s)" of the next opcode. By comparison, this goes further than the JVM. If you are familiar with it, the JVM [erases](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/erasure.html) the generic types, so when your Java code contained a `List<T extends Animal>`, the compiled bytecode only mentions a `List`. By contrast, the Michelson bytecode still would have your `List<Animal>`, `List<SchroedingerCat>` or whichever inner type the compiler was able to collapse to.

### Storage, not memory

Moreover, unlike the JVM or the EVM, it does not use a heap, or a memory if you will. It does have access to what is called `storage`, which, in effect, represents the only data that is persisted within the system across transactions and time.

So, a Michelson program takes in a 1-level-deep stack with a pair of a parameter and storage, and outputs a 1-level-deep stack with a pair of an operation list and modified storage. Since there is no memory, the stack is also where the program gets its input from: The input is the only element in the stack when calling the program; the parameter is the left part of that input tuple, and that parameter can be a tuple. Conversely, the output is the only element in the stack when the program exits.

A Tezos node will directly execute a serialised Michelson program when asked to.

## Our first contract

Time to deploy our first Tezos contract! 

Create a new file `repeater.tz` in the same folder as `edonet.sh` and paste:

```michelson
parameter int;
storage int;
code { CAR ;
       NIL operation ;
       PAIR };
```
into it. Then save it.

This is a **repeater contract**, which will take an integer as a parameter and return it, in effect saving that number in the storage.

Remember that in Tezos, each contract takes as input one pair of a parameter and storage structure, and then returns, as output, one pair consisting of an operation list and another storage structure. It is stack-based.

Before any contract operation, the stack has been populated by the Tezos environment according to the transaction that spawned the contract. The stack has one level, populated with the input pair. Our code here has **3 instructions**:

1. We pop this input pair from the top of the stack, we take the left-hand part of the input pair `CAR`, i.e. the input parameter, and push that back into the top of the stack. At this stage, the stack is still 1-level deep as the pair was consumed and replaced with the parameter;
2. We push an empty operation list, `NIL operation`, to the top of the stack. At this stage, the stack is 2-level deep;
3. We make a pair of both levels of the stack with the operation list on the left, `PAIR`. Each instruction is working on the stack, e.g. `PAIR` will take the parameter and operation list from the stack and push a pair. The stack is back to being 1-level deep.

At this stage, the Tezos environment takes the output storage structure, here an `int`, puts it in storage and executes the operations, if there are any.

![Stack changing with operations](images/stack.png)

Before we deploy this contract, we can test it with any test parameter and storage:

```sh
$ ./edonet.sh client run script container:repeater.tz on storage 0 and input 1
```
It will give you as a result:

```
storage
  1
emitted operations
  
big_map diff
```

Notice the trick we did here? We did not pretend that it was deployed and that it had a certain storage. Instead we passed all the needed inputs - namely parameter and input storage - to the function that this contract represents. The contract _function_ does not need any context or other parameters to run.

We can also check the stack:

```
$ ./edonet.sh client typecheck script container:repeater.tz -details
Warning:
  
                 This is NOT the Tezos Mainnet.
  
           Do NOT use your fundraiser keys on this network.

Well typed
Gas remaining: 1039996.720 units remaining
{ parameter int ;
  storage int ;
  code { /* [ pair (int @parameter) (int @storage) ] */
         CAR
         /* [ @parameter int ] */ ;
         NIL operation
         /* [ list operation : @parameter int ] */ ;
         PAIR
         /* [ pair (list operation) (int @parameter) ] */ } }
```

So it starts with one element `[ pair (int @parameter) (int @storage) ]` in the stack and ends with one element `pair (list operation) (int @parameter)`. Each element in the stack is separated by `:`. Take your time to compare this output with the image.

Satisfied with this exhaustive battery of tests, let us deploy this contract:

```sh
$ ./edonet.sh client originate contract repeater for myFirstKey transferring 0.1 from myFirstKey running container:repeater.tz --init 0 --burn-cap 0.295

Tezos offers two kinds of accounts, [implicit and originated](https://github.com/tezoscommunity/faq/wiki/Tezos-Technical-FAQ#what-is-the-difference-between-implicit-and-originated-accounts).

Only originated accounts can have Michelson code, though this may change in the future via a Tezos amendment.

</HighlightBox>

Now, with:

```sh
$ ./edonet.sh client list known contracts
Warning:
  
                 This is NOT the Tezos Mainnet.
  
          Do NOT use your fundraiser keys on this network.

repeater: KT1E7MZbQay94N4uFnxGGg6eBZxdnyLY8BjB
faucetWallet: tz1Z47xv2h6GnFvuUUbBz3qTgoNqmiRxZNm1
myFirstKey: tz1W4W2yFAHz7iGyQvFys4K7Df9mZL6cSKCp
```
you can see the address of our contract. Your client gives aliases to some addresses for your convenience. You can add aliases or do it without too.

Time to do our **first contract interaction**, here known as `transfer`:

```sh
$ ./edonet.sh client transfer 0 from myFirstKey to repeater --arg "1"
```
In the output, you will see `Updated storage: 1`.

## JSON/RPC interface

So far we have used the edonet script to execute **tezos-client** commands. This client communicates with the **tezos-node**.

Communication works with the help of the **JSON/RPC interface**. The **tezos-node** responses are **JSON** based. Notice it is not the **JSON-RPC** protocol, the communication is done over **HTTP** protocol.

Let's first list what the RPC offers:

```
$ ./edonet.sh client rpc list
```

This should list you the `GET/POST` queries you can do. 

Analogous to the previous section we want to get the balance first.

First, we need to see all the addresses in our wallet:

```
$ ./edonet.sh client list known addresses
```

Look for `myFirstKey` from the last section and use its address to get the balance, replace the `MYFIRSTKEY_ADDRESS` string in the following command with it:

```
$ ./edonet.sh client rpc get /chains/main/blocks/head/context/contracts/MYFIRSTKEY_ADDRESS/balance
```

Now you should see the balance. But where is the JSON we are talking about? Let us add a flag and use the command again:

```
$ ./edonet.sh client -l rpc get /chains/main/blocks/head/context/contracts/MYFIRSTKEY_ADDRESS/balance
```

This time you should see the HTTP requests and the JSON responses the client does. 

<HighlightBox type="tip">

You can find the reference for the JSON/RPC interface at the [Tezos Developer Resources documentation](https://tezos.gitlab.io/mainnet/api/rpc.html).

</HighlightBox>

We can use the flag `-l` for all commands from previous section. So, if you run the command:

```
$ ./edonet.sh client transfer 1 from faucetWallet to myFirstKey --burn-cap 0.5
```

from last section, you will see all the queries and responses traveling in the background. 

We can also use `curl` for a request 
if you start the network and with an exposed RPC port:

```
./edonet.sh start --rpc-port 8732
```

Let us request the balance again:

```
curl -s localhost:8732/chains/main/blocks/head/context/contracts/MYFIRSTKEY_ADDRESS/balance
```

<HighlightBox type="tip">

We could continue endlessly listing how different requests and their responses look. For the interested reader, we recommend checking out the [full description](https://tezos.gitlab.io/007/rpc.html).
