<OverviewBox title="All you need to develop with Tezos" imgSrc="/img/hero-02-01-t.png" floating="true">

The Tezos Developer Portal is the perfect place to discover all there is to Tezos: its architecture and ecosystem, deploying smart contracts, and setting up and working with clients.

Tezos is an open-source platform addressing key barriers facing blockchain adoption by improving smart contract safety, long-term upgradability, and open participation.

It is designed to:
* Offer open participation to all stakeholders,
* Provide secure, institutional-grade smart contracts, among others through the use of its native smart contract language, Michelson,
* Allow the network to propose and adopt technological innovation through the modular architecture and formal upgrade mechanism,
* Align incentives for increased network security through the help of all stakeholders.

</OverviewBox>

Start with the [Blockchain Fundamentals](/blockchain-fundamentals/landingpage) to understand the fundamentals of blockchain technology and how they translate into Tezos. As you work through the chapters, you will install everything you need to get started and dive deeper.

In the Tezos Developer Portal you will find:
* An introduction into blockchain fundamentals and Tezos, from how consensus works to Tezos’ deployment pattern 
* An overview of the Tezos architecture
* How to participate in a Tezos network and the first steps you need to take
* Information on developing and deploying smart contracts in Tezos, including an introduction to SmartPy, the Web IDE, and Michelson
* How to setup a client and fetch information from the blockchain using Taquito and the TzKT API
* A dive into the ecosystem addressing decentralized exchange, Beacon, and FA2 interface
