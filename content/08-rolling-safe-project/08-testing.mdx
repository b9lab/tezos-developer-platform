In this section, we will take a closer look at testing, more specifically:

* Testing with the SmartPy IDE, and
* Unit tests for the wrappers.

<!-- Please expand the introduction. -->

## SmartPy testing in the IDE

We test our TZMINT web application on different levels with different tools.

Let us start with the SmartPy IDE for testing. First, we need to **define our scenario**:

```python
@sp.add_test(name= "ContractTest")
def ContractTest():

    # dummy addresses
    organization = sp.address("tz1hRTppkUow3wQNcj9nZ9s5snwc6sGC8QHh")
    buyer1 = sp.address("tz1xbuyer1")
    buyer2 = sp.address("tz1xbuyer2")

    # initial price
    initial_price = sp.tez(1)

    contract= PEQ(
        organization = organization,
        buy_slope = 2000,
        sell_slope = 1000,
        initial_price = initial_price,
        MFG = sp.tez(1000),
        preminted = 0,
        MPT = 1, # minimal period of time in years
        I = 90,
        D = 80,
        company_valuation = 1000000,
        total_allocation = 4000,
        stake_allocation = 500,
        termination_events = ["Sale", "Bankruptcy"],
        govRights = "None",
        company_name = "TZMINT Demo"
        )

    buy_price_helper_initial = TestHelper.buy_price_helper_initial
    buy_price_helper_slope = TestHelper.buy_price_helper_slope
    sell_price_helper_slope = TestHelper.sell_price_helper_slope

    scenario = sp.test_scenario()
    scenario += contract
```

The test starts with the initialization of the `contract`. Most of the initial parameters are arbitrary. We have some helper functions in order to test our contract:

```python
class TestHelper:
    # Helper functions for the price testing
    @staticmethod
    def buy_price_helper_initial(buyer, tez_amount, buyer_amount_of_tokens, const_price, scenario, contract, first=False):

        # if the user is not in the ledger, the user has 0 tokens
        buyer_amount_of_tokens = 0

        # check if the user is in the ledger
        if not first:
            buyer_amount_of_tokens = scenario.compute(contract.data.ledger[buyer])
        balance = scenario.compute(contract.balance)

        # call the buy entrypoint
        scenario += contract.buy().run(sender = buyer, amount = tez_amount)

        # check that the excess is sent back
        token_amount = sp.utils.mutez_to_nat(tez_amount) // sp.utils.mutez_to_nat(const_price)
        payed_tez_amount = token_amount * sp.utils.mutez_to_nat(const_price)
        scenario.verify(contract.balance ==  sp.utils.nat_to_mutez(payed_tez_amount) + balance)

        # check that the correct amount of tokens is issued
        buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens = scenario.compute(sp.as_nat(contract.data.ledger[buyer]- buyer_amount_of_tokens))
        scenario.verify(buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens == token_amount)

        # return the token_amount for the next call so it can be verified
        return token_amount

    @staticmethod
    def buy_price_helper_left(tez_amount, scenario, contract):
        # left side of the equation, have a look at the content for more information
        return scenario.compute(2 * sp.utils.mutez_to_nat(tez_amount) / contract.data.buy_slope + contract.data.total_tokens * contract.data.total_tokens)

    @staticmethod
    def buy_price_helper_right(buyer, buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens, total_amount, scenario, contract):
        # right side of the equation, have a look at the content for more information
        return scenario.compute(buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens*buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens + total_amount*total_amount + 2*total_amount*buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens)

    @staticmethod
    def buy_price_helper_slope(buyer, tez_amount, buyer_old_token_amount, scenario, contract, first= False):
        
        # if the user is not in the ledger, the user has 0 tokens
        buyer_amount_of_tokens = 0

        # check if the user is in the ledger
        if not first:
            buyer_amount_of_tokens = scenario.compute(contract.data.ledger[buyer])

        # check that buyer has the correct amount of tokens
        scenario.verify(buyer_amount_of_tokens == buyer_old_token_amount)
        total_amount = scenario.compute(contract.data.total_tokens)
        left_side = TestHelper.buy_price_helper_left(tez_amount, scenario, contract)

        # call buy entrypoint
        scenario += contract.buy().run(sender = buyer, amount = tez_amount)
        buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens = scenario.compute(sp.as_nat(contract.data.ledger[buyer]- buyer_amount_of_tokens))
        right_side = TestHelper.buy_price_helper_right(buyer, buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens, total_amount, scenario, contract)

        # check if the correct amount of tokens is issued
        # which is also a check of the buy price
        scenario += contract.square_root_test(x = left_side, y = right_side)

        # return the minted amount of tokens for the next test
        return buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens
    
    def sell_price_helper_slope(tokens, scenario, contract):

        # calculate the amount of tez needed to be sent
        pay_amount = scenario.compute(sp.as_nat(contract.data.total_tokens * sp.as_nat(tokens) * contract.data.sell_slope -
                        sp.as_nat(tokens * tokens) * contract.data.sell_slope / 2
                        ) +
                        contract.data.sell_slope * sp.as_nat(tokens) *
                        contract.data.burned_tokens * contract.data.burned_tokens /
                        sp.as_nat(2 * (contract.data.total_tokens - contract.data.burned_tokens)))

        # return pay_amount for the verification
        return pay_amount
```

Now we can start **testing for `buy`** in the initial phase:

```python
    # buy some tokens in the intial phase, verify the token amounts and the buy price
    # and verify that the excess is sent back
    buyer1_token_amount  = buy_price_helper_initial(buyer1, (sp.tez(500) + sp.mutez(1000)), 0, initial_price, scenario, contract, True)
    buyer2_token_amount  = buy_price_helper_initial(buyer2, (sp.tez(200) + sp.mutez(3000)), 0, initial_price, scenario, contract, True)
    buyer1_token_amount += buy_price_helper_initial(buyer1, sp.tez(300), 0, initial_price, scenario, contract)

```

Notice that we write `(sp.tez(500) + sp.mutez(1000)` explicitly because we expect `sp.mutez(1000)` to be sent back because of `initial_price = sp.tez(1) = sp.mutez(1000000)`. The same applies to the other tests until we reach the minimum funding goal (MFG):

```python
    # check that the price has not changed
    scenario.verify(contract.data.price == initial_price)
    # check that MFG is reached but surpassed
    scenario.verify(contract.data.MFG == contract.balance)
```

In addition, we check that the **price does not change** in the MFG phase - This will be different after the MFG is reached (post-MFG):

```python
    # buy some tokens in the slopy phase
    # verify the amount of issued tokens and the buy price
    buyer1_token_amount += buy_price_helper_slope(buyer1, tez_amount= sp.tez(50), buyer_old_token_amount= buyer1_token_amount, scenario= scenario, contract= contract)
    buyer2_token_amount += buy_price_helper_slope(buyer2, tez_amount = sp.tez(400), buyer_old_token_amount = buyer2_token_amount, scenario = scenario, contract = contract)
    buyer1_token_amount += buy_price_helper_slope(buyer1, tez_amount = sp.tez(100), buyer_old_token_amount = buyer1_token_amount, scenario = scenario, contract = contract)
    
    # verify that the excess is sent back
    buyer1_token_amount += buy_price_helper_slope(buyer1, tez_amount = sp.mutez(51245389), buyer_old_token_amount = buyer1_token_amount, scenario = scenario, contract = contract)

    # verify that the price is higher than the initial_price
    scenario.verify(contract.data.price > initial_price)
```

The `buy_price_helper_initial` function should be clear if you look at the code and the comments. We want to explain `buy_price_helper_slope` in more detail. For that, let us start with the `_left` and `_right` helper functions:

```python
    @staticmethod
    def buy_price_helper_left(tez_amount, scenario, contract):
        # left side of the equation, have a look at the content for more information
        return scenario.compute(2 * sp.utils.mutez_to_nat(tez_amount) / contract.data.buy_slope + contract.data.total_tokens * contract.data.total_tokens)

    @staticmethod
    def buy_price_helper_right(buyer, buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens, total_amount, scenario, contract):
        # right side of the equation, have a look at the content for more information
        return scenario.compute(buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens*buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens + total_amount*total_amount + 2*total_amount*buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens)
```

We want to verify the price calculation of the `buy` entrypoint in the sloppy phase. Remember, for the calculation we use:

![Calculating the buy price post-MFG](/images/buy-calculus-formula-1.png)

Now we want to check if `x` has the correct value. 

The regular way to check a calculation like this is to square the equation - keep in mind that the solution of the equation does not change if we keep `x>0`. We will square but use the square root again:

![Calculating the buy price post-MFG](/images/buy-calculus-formula-2.png)

Because we use an [integer square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_square_root) in our contract. To make sure the solution is correct, we need to use the integer square root here too.

```python
    @staticmethod
    def buy_price_helper_slope(buyer, tez_amount, buyer_old_token_amount, scenario, contract, first= False):
        
        # if the user is not in the ledger, the user has 0 tokens
        buyer_amount_of_tokens = 0

        # check if the user is in the ledger
        if not first:
            buyer_amount_of_tokens = scenario.compute(contract.data.ledger[buyer])

        # check that the buyer has the correct amount of tokens
        scenario.verify(buyer_amount_of_tokens == buyer_old_token_amount)
        total_amount = scenario.compute(contract.data.total_tokens)
        left_side = TestHelper.buy_price_helper_left(tez_amount, scenario, contract)

        # call buy entrypoint
        scenario += contract.buy().run(sender = buyer, amount = tez_amount)
        buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens = scenario.compute(sp.as_nat(contract.data.ledger[buyer]- buyer_amount_of_tokens))
        right_side = TestHelper.buy_price_helper_right(buyer, buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens, total_amount, scenario, contract)

        # check if the correct amount of tokens is issued
        # which is also a check of the buy price
        scenario += contract.square_root_test(x = left_side, y = right_side)

        # return the minted amount of tokens for the next test
        return buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens
```

Notice that in addition to the calculation of the both sides, we use:

```python
    scenario += contract.square_root_test(x = left_side, y = right_side)
```

Where:

```python
    #define a private entrypoint for testing
    @sp.entry_point(private = True)
    def square_root_test(self, params):
        sp.verify(self.square_root(params.x) == self.square_root(params.y))
```

Because our `square_root` is not an entrypoint and we want to test a transaction. Keep in mind that a private entrypoint will not be compiled and added to the contract, so those are useful for testing.

Also have a look at how we fetch the number of the tokens issued:

```python
        scenario += contract.buy().run(sender = buyer, amount = tez_amount)
        buyer_amount_of_last_buyed_tokens = scenario.compute(sp.as_nat(contract.data.ledger[buyer]- buyer_amount_of_tokens))
```

Next, we want to **sell some tokens** and check the call:

```python
    # check that the correct amount of tez is sent if one token is sold
    # sell 100 tokens with buyer1
    token_amount = 100

    # store the balance before selling
    balance = scenario.compute(contract.balance)

    # calculate the expected tez amount to be received
    pay_amount = sell_price_helper_slope(token_amount, scenario, contract)

    # call the sell entrypoint
    scenario += contract.sell(amount=token_amount).run(sender = buyer1)

    # verify that the correct amount is payed to the user
    scenario.verify(contract.balance == balance- sp.utils.nat_to_mutez(pay_amount))

    # update buyer1_token_amount
    buyer1_token_amount= sp.as_nat(buyer1_token_amount- token_amount)

    # verify the amount of tokens for buyer1
    scenario.verify(buyer1_token_amount == contract.data.ledger[buyer1])

```

This way we can also check the sell price for one token:

```python
    # check that the correct amount of tez is sent if one token is sold
    # this will also verify the price for a token
    token_amount = 1
    balance = scenario.compute(contract.balance)
    pay_amount = sell_price_helper_slope(token_amount, scenario, contract)
    scenario += contract.sell(amount=1).run(sender = buyer1)
    scenario.verify(contract.balance == balance- sp.utils.nat_to_mutez(pay_amount))
```

You can also check the **price of a token** with the output of:

```python
    # Check price for selling 1 token
    scenario += contract.sell(amount=1).run(sender = buyer1)
```

In the right panel of the IDE:

![Test output](./images/test-output.png)

As you can see, the seller (i.e. previous buyer) receives 2.460328 tez for one token.

The last thing to test is the **closing** and the permissions for calling it:

```python
    # check closing before MPT
    scenario += contract.close().run(sender = organization, valid=False, amount = sp.tez(2400), now= sp.timestamp_from_utc_now().add_days(360))
    # check closing with wrong account
    scenario += contract.close().run(sender = buyer1, valid=False, now= sp.timestamp_from_utc_now().add_days(365))
    # check closing with not enough tez
    scenario += contract.close().run(sender = organization, valid=False, amount = sp.tez(300), now= sp.timestamp_from_utc_now().add_days(365))
    # check closing with correct amount of tez
    scenario += contract.close().run(sender = organization, amount = sp.tez(2400), now= sp.timestamp_from_utc_now().add_days(365))
```

## Unit tests for the wrappers

We use [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for unit tests. There are different unit tests for each wrapper.

The `walletWrapper` is very small, so there is not much to test besides the `callCount`s of the inner functions:

```javascript
        it("should call only buy in the contract if buy is called", async function() {
            expect(contract).to.have.property("buy");
            const result = await contract.buy(getRandomInt(10));

            expect(buy.callCount).to.equal(1);
            expect(sell.callCount).to.equal(0);
        });
```

This applies also to the unit tests for the `contractWrapper`.

The `chainWrapper` is more complex. We want to make sure it offers the functions the `DataHandler` needs, so we use `to.have.property` to make sure:

```javascript
    ...
            expect(storage).to.have.property("I");
            expect(storage).to.have.property("D");
            expect(storage).to.have.property("b");
            expect(storage).to.have.property("s");
    ...
```

In addition, we can pass the real network configuration and test the return types:

```javascript
    ...
        it("should return the d", async function() {
            const blockchain = chainWrapper(config),
                administrator = await blockchain.d();

            expect(administrator).to.be.a("number");
        });

        it("should return the unlockingDate", async function() {
            const blockchain = chainWrapper(config),
                administrator = await blockchain.unlockingDate();

            expect(administrator).to.be.a("string");
        });
    ...
```

Integration tests for the `walletWrapper` and the `contractWrapper` require a different approach because of the browser extensions needed to use a wallet.
