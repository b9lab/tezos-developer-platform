Blockchain technology has enabled the development of new financial instruments and mechanisms. Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is the umbrella term for all Peer-to-peer decentralised financial services and applications built on blockchains. DeFi contrasts with traditional finance as DeFi does not need central, trusted intermediaries for transactions, like banks, clearing houses, or centralised exchanges. DeFi uses smart contracts to govern transactions.

Equally, the transparent and immutable nature of blockchains themselves negates the need for a trusted third party, the intermediary, to steward the transaction as all transactions are interrogable.

Clearly, cryptocurrencies are the most visible and basic form of DeFi. The next level of complexity is tokenization, where the token is a digital representation of ownership, be it a share in a company, an artwork, or a house. It is logical for startups in the blockchain space to use the technology to help raise capital and fund their growth. Hence the proliferation of initial coin offerings (ICOs), followed by Security Token Offerings (STOs) and a number of other asset raising ideas.

<HighlightBox type="info">
The majority of the blockchain ‘offering’ type asset raises partially mirrored the initial public offerings (IPOs) seen in the traditional financial markets where companies ‘go public’ and list their stock on exchanges, creating public equity. (There are many significant differences between IPOs and even the most respectable ICOs, including regulation and questions of ownership, but that is a discussion for another piece.)

A great deal of early funding for blockchain startups still comes through the same route as other non-blockchain startups - *Private Equity*. In the very early stages investment often comes from friends and family, and investing ‘Angels.’ As the company matures, the founders may look to professional investors at Venture Capital firms and funds for a source of capital. 

<HighlightBox type="info">
All these types of investment are predominantly exchanged for equity in the company; a representation of the value of the investor's stake by owning a portion of its shares.

The early stage funding space of seed rounds and more formal Venture Capital funding series, is ripe for innovation and disruption. The *Rolling Simple Agreement For Future Equity (Rolling SAFE)* is a blockchain based innovation that focuses primarily on the seed funding round of a startup.  The seeding round is typically the very first time an entrepreneur will look externally to fund their new project.
