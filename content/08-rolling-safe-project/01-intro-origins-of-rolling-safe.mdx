Blockchain technology has enabled the development of new financial instruments and mechanisms subsumed under the overarching term Decentralized Finance (DeFi). DeFi contrasts with traditional finance as it does not require central, trusted intermediaries for transactions like banks, clearing houses, or centralised exchanges. Instead, smart contracts are used to manage transactions and implement DeFi instruments as the transparent and immutable nature of blockchains negates the need to involve a trusted third party, i.e an intermediary. Cryptocurrencies are the most prominent and basic form of DeFi. The next level of complexity is tokenization, where the token is a digital representation of ownership, be it a share in a company, a valuable asset, or physical good like an artwork or a house.

Startups in the blockchain space use the technology to help raise capital and fund their business' growth. Hence the proliferation of initial coin offerings (ICOs) was followed by security token offerings (STOs) and a number of other asset raising ideas.

The majority of blockchain-based asset "offerings" partially mirrored initial public offerings (IPOs) in traditional financial markets, where companies "go public" and list their stock on exchanges, creating public equity. There are many significant differences between IPOs and even the most respectable ICOs, including questions of regulation and ownership, but that is a discussion for another time.

A great deal of early funding for blockchain startups still comes through the same route as for other non-blockchain startups - private equity. In the very early stages, investment often comes from friends and family, and so-called angel investors. As the company matures, the founders may look to professional investors at venture capital firms and funds as a source of capital.

All these types of investment are predominantly exchanged for equity in a company, i.e. a representation of the value of the investor's stake by owning a portion of a company's shares.

The early stage funding phase of seed rounds and more formal venture capital funding series is ripe for innovation and disruption. The **Rolling Simple Agreement for Future Equity (Rolling SAFE)** is a blockchain-based innovation that focuses primarily on early funding for a startup. The seeding round is typically the very first time an entrepreneur will look externally to fund their new project.

<ExpansionPanel title="Raising capital - Funding mechanisms and startup financing cycles">

### The startup financing cycle

It is no secret that many startups fail due to cash flow issues or lack of cash in general. A company looking for an injection of cash to fund startup costs can either look to take on debt (through bank loans, capital markets or other debt instruments) or issue equity in exchange for investment from venture capitalists. In this section we are going to look at raising capital through private equity using the venture capital route.

When starting a new venture, the revenue brought in by sales often does not cover the cost of starting and running the venture, never mind actually creating a profit / net income. So startups seek money from other sources, one of them being investment from external entities in a seeding round.  

<HighlightBox type="info">

Wonder why it is called Seed round and you gather seed capital? The business is only a seed, it’s not yet a fully grown company! A seed round is like the planting of a tree, the seed will not grow overnight into a massive oak but the planting of the seed is the first step.

</HighlightBox>

Broadly speaking a startup would look for funding from friends, family and Angel investors during the ‘valley of death’ stage, where revenue (if there is any at all) does not cover costs. This is the seed round, where a company founder can get funding based on a great idea and a compelling business plan. Naturally, investing at this stage is likely to be the most risky as the investor may not be able to see an existing project to evaluate its likelihood of success. This means investment amounts are normally much smaller than in later funding rounds but often represent a similar stake in the company. 

![Startup financing cycle](images/startup-financing-cycle.png)

As soon as the company has reached break even, and can demonstrate product market fit and traction, it is more attractive to professional venture capital investors, be it venture capital funds, investment banks, sovereign wealth funds and other more formal pools of capital.

For the sake of expediency we’re going to call these collectively VC firms, even though that’s not strictly true.

VC firms are most interested in investment when they can see a working business and can evaluate the likelihood of exponential growth in future revenues. It is at this point that a company would look to raise money in a series of formal funding rounds, typically, series A, B, and C rounds. As with seed investing, investors in series A, B, and C will expect some form of partial ownership of the company, usually through equity. However, in these later rounds of funding the investors have a working company to evaluate and so are seen to be taking progressively less risk. This means that the amount of equity they can expect in return for an investment decreases. An investor investing /$ 100,000 in the seed round would have expected much more equity in return than an investor who invested /$ 100,000 after a year of successful trading. 

Each series, in theory, relates to a different stage in the company’s development (and a different issue of shares, but more about that later). Of course, in reality the lines between the different stages are blurry and the stage of the company may not match exactly, but these are the broad bands for the stages:

*Series A:* In series A funding, investors are not just looking for great ideas. Rather, they are looking for companies with great ideas as well as a strong strategy for turning that idea into a successful, money-making business. 

*Series B:* Generally speaking series B is focused on expanding market reach. Companies looking to raise at this stage will have developed substantial user bases and have proven to investors that they are prepared for success on a larger scale. Series B funding is used to grow the company so that it can meet these levels of demand.

*Series C:* A series C round is for additional funding in order to help an already successful company develop new products, expand into new markets, or even to acquire other companies. Series C funding is focused on scaling the company, growing as quickly and as successfully as possible. Companies engaging in series C funding should have established, strong customer bases, revenue streams, and proven histories of growth.

Some companies can go on to series D and even series E rounds. For the most part, though, companies gaining up to hundreds of millions of dollars in funding through series C rounds are able to develop on a global scale. Many of these companies utilize series C funding to help boost their valuation in anticipation of an IPO.

Now that we have covered the broad scope of venture capital and the various rounds of asset raising for new businesses, it is time to look at the mechanisms that are used to deliver the funds from the investor to the company. In this section we will look at convertible notes, and common and preference shares. In the next section, we will move onto SAFEs and finally Rolling SAFEs.

### Convertible notes

In the very early stages of a company’s life, especially at the seed round, when it’s an idea and a business plan, it is quite hard to put a value on the company. This means it is tricky to work out how much equity a company founder should give away in return for an investment. The founder, filled with the vision and passion for the company’s success is likely to have a very different conception of what their company is worth versus an investor. This is where a convertible note can help both parties come to an agreement.  

<HighlightBox type="info">

A convertible note is a debt instrument. It is a way for a startup company to borrow money, normally with a lower interest rate that they could get at a bank - if they could get a loan at all.  For the investor, there is the added bonus of being able to convert their debt into equity (normally preferred stock, which will cover later). This conversion typically takes place at the same time as the series A round.  At this point the valuation of the company is much clearer as there are far more data points than when the initial investment was made. 

</HighlightBox>

However, as it is still a debt instrument, the company will need to pay interest and pay back the principal (the original loan) at the maturity of the note. This is the case if the event that triggers conversion has not happened before the maturity date (the event normally being the series A round). 

As with all private deals, there are differences from note to note, and we are covering the ideas in general rather than specifics. However, there are four key variables in a convertible note that you should look out for:

* *Discount rate:* This is the discount the investor receives relative to investors in the subsequent financing round (usually series A).  This discount compensates the investor for taking on the risk of investing early. For example, with a discount rate of 20%, if a series A investor could buy a share for /$ 10, the note holder would be able to convert their investment at the equivalent value of /$ 8 a share (discount rates can be anything from 10% to 40% or occasionally more, most often around 20%).
* *Valuation cap:* This effectively caps the price at which an investor will convert their note. In the example above, if the note had the equivalent of a cap of /$ 5 a share, that would be the conversion price, instead of /$ 8 at the 20% discount rate (valuation caps are usually quoted as the valuation of the whole company rather on a share by share basis, to extend the example above, the note could have a valuation cap of /$ 5m with the company having pre-money valuation of /$ 10m. We will discuss pre and post money in the next section).
* *Interest rate:* As the convertible note is a debt instrument, it will more often than not accrue interest. However, as opposed to being paid back during the note’s lifetime the interest normally accrues to the principal invested. This means that the number of shares issued is increased on conversion. Interest rates are often within the 2%-8% range. 
* *Maturity date:* The date on which the company will have to repay the interest and the principal to the investor (if the note has not been converted). 

### A share issue
As we’ve previously stated, investors often expect to receive stock for investing money in a startup company. For an early stage investor, *Preferred Stock* is the preferred option! Here we’re going to discuss the role that equity / stock / shares play in the early stage of the company.

Equity is lowest in a company’s capital structure, below any debt the company might have. This means that in the event of the company going bankrupt equity holders will be paid out last and will probably receive very little. This is because all the creditors above them in the capital structure will be paid out first. 

<HighlightBox type="info">

There are lots of types of debt and equity, but we are going to focus on the two most usual types of equity: *Common (ordinary) stock* and *preferred stock*. First we are going to look at common stock in order to contrast it with preferred stock and why an early stage investor would prefer preferred stock.

</HighlightBox>

Common stock is very common, as the vast majority of stock is issued as common stock. In fact, when people talk about stocks, they are normally referring to common stock. A large chunk of common stock is issued by a company at IPO (initial public offering) when the company ‘goes public’ and is listed on a stock exchange.  

Common stock is lowest in the capital structure and therefore has the most associated risk, as it is the last to get paid in the event of a bankruptcy. However, common stockholders also have the potential for the most reward, in capital gains when the stock increases in value, and through a claim on profits (dividends), when the profits of the company are distributed to shareholders. Common stockholders are also able to vote on important company decisions.

Preferred stock is above common stock in a company’s capital structure, meaning holders have priority over the company's income and are paid dividends before Common Stockholders. However, preferred stock may not confer voting rights like common stock (The preferred stock issued in VC rounds often has different control rights, for example a board seat or veto rights). 

Preferred stock often has a guaranteed dividend yield while common stock has variable, and never guaranteed dividends. 

<HighlightBox type="tip">

To calculate the dividend yield, the preferred stock also has a par value, like a bond. Say the stock had a par value of /$ 25 and a dividend yield of 5%, the company would have to pay the holder /$ 1.25 a year. If the company misses a dividend payment it must first pay the arrears to the preferred stockholders before paying out to common shareholders.  

</HighlightBox>

Preferred shares often have a callability feature, which allows the company to redeem the shares after a predetermined time, often at a high premium to the original purchase price. Also, often they can be converted to a fixed number of common shares.

Now, here is where it all comes together: You will probably have noticed that when we have been talking about preferred stock, there has been lots of caveats, using words like ‘typically’ and ‘often’ that is because the terms of preferred stock can vary. The terms of preferred stock, issued in a private round, can be negotiated between the investor (or group of investors) and the company. And the stock is issued in series, series A, series B etc - which is why the funding rounds are called series A, series B etc! 

Each series has a defined number of shares that the company is prepared to issue in exchange for a defined investment amount. Each round will have their own set of terms, generally speaking, the later the round the less favorable the terms for the investor as the perceived risk is reduced over time. 

Equally, the preferred stock is likely to have anti-dilution provisions, which are clauses designed to protect the investor’s ownership percentage in the company. Percentage ownership is maintained by linking preferred shares to a number of common shares. If a company issues more common stock (say in an IPO) the number of common shares that a preferred share can convert to also increases in line, meaning that the preferred shareholder’s percentage ownership of the company remains the same. This is not the case for common share ownership which will be diluted as other common shares are issued - common shareholders have the same slice of the pie, but now have more claims on the slice! As early stage investors invest before the IPO, it’s clearly more preferable to hold preference shares. 

<HighlightBox type="info">

The possible conversion of preference share to common stock is one of the key ways an early stage investor can exit their investment. At IPO, it is likely the investor will be able to convert their prefered stock for a certain number of common stock and then sell that stock on an exchange.  

</HighlightBox>

As you can imagine, the various exit strategies for an investor are an important part of the decision to invest in the first place. Investors often look for a company that has a clear path to exit in one of three ways: 

* To be attractive to competitors and therefore be a candidate for a merger or acquisition - a ‘trade sale’,
* A company that is building value for a different type of investor in the Secondary Buy-out Market, e.g. another private equity firm that can take the business to the next level, or
* An IPO, which we have focused on above.

## The origin of Rolling SAFEs: A Simple Agreement for Future Equity

A Simple Agreement for Future Equity (SAFE) was designed as a more simple replacement for convertible notes.

<HighlightBox type="tip">

See the expandable box above for an explanation of convertible notes.

</HighlightBox>

When an investor invests in a company using a SAFE, they exchange the money for the right to future equity in the company at a trigger event. (Both SAFEs and convertible notes are also used for later-stage bridge finance, but that’s not relevant here.)

Similar to convertible notes, a SAFE postpones the problem of valuing the company until a later date when the equity is transferred to the investor at the trigger event. Valuing a company at a very early stage is difficult, especially if it is just some founders, an idea and a business plan.  Postponing the valuation until there are more data points is a logical way to solve the problem.

Let us get trigger events out of the way. A trigger event is normally either when a priced round of investment occurs (like a series A round) or a liquidity event occurs (like the company getting bought by a competitor). Clearly the key is that the event includes the striking of a price. If the company is in a position to raise funds in a formal series round, there must now be some consensus on the company valuation, the same if the company is bought. As we now have a consensus on price, the SAFE can convert to equity or be bought out at an agreed rate.

SAFEs were created by [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/) in 2013 with the intention to simplify the early stage asset raising process. It was a short document with little space for negotiation other than key areas that were clearly set out. SAFEs have evolved since 2013 and can now have almost as many moving parts as a convertible note. However, certain differences still remain true:

* In contrast with a convertible note, a SAFE is not a debt instrument, the company does not need to pay back the principal and it does not accrue interest, 
* As an extension of this, a SAFE also does not have a maturity date, meaning there is no need to arrange extensions if the trigger event has not been reached. 

The key, most common areas for negotiation in a SAFE are the discount rate, the valuation cap, pro-rata rights and Most Favoured Nation clause. A SAFE can have a combination of any of them, or all of them.

*Discount rate:* This is the discount the investor receives relative to investors in the subsequent financing round (usually Series A). This discount compensates the investor for taking on the risk of investing early.

<HighlightBox type="info">

*For example:* 
With a discount rate of 20%, if a series A investor could buy a share for /$ 10, the SAFE holder would be able to convert their investment at the equivalent value of /$ 8 a share (Discount rates can be anything from 10% to 30% or occasionally more, most often around 20%).

</HighlightBox>

*Valuation cap:* This effectively caps the price at which an investor will convert their SAFE. In the example above, if the SAFE had the equivalent of a cap of /$ 5 a share, that would be the conversion price, instead of /$ 8 at the 20% discount rate. If a SAFE has both a valuation cap and a discount rate, the investor can choose which to exercise, logically an investor will choose the lowest price.

<HighlightBox type="tip">

Valuation caps are usually quoted as the valuation of the whole company rather on a share by share basis, to extend the example above, the SAFE could have a valuation cap of /$ 5m with the company having a pre-money valuation of /$ 10m.

</HighlightBox>

*Pro rata rights (or participations rights):* Allows the investor to invest additional funds to maintain their ownership percentage during rounds after their equity was converted. To extend the example above again, the company decides to do another financing round in a series B. The investor converted at /$ 5 a share in series A (because of the valuation cap). The SAFE now allows them to buy more shares in series B at the series B price - let us say /$ 15, - up to an amount that keeps their ownership of the company at the same percentage (This was an automatic clause in the original 2013 SAFEs, but is now more commonly a negotiated side note).

*Most Favoured Nation Clause (MFN):* An MFN simply means that no other investor can have better terms than the ones set out in the SAFE with the MFN clause. They can have the same terms, just not better (eg a lower valuation cap or higher discount rate). This rewards the original SAFE investor for taking an early risk (MFN clauses can not be applied retroactively i.e. a series B investor cannot ask for an MFN clause that affects a series A investor).

The original SAFEs conceived in 2013 were formally updated by YCombinator in 2018. Admittedly, SAFEs are an open resource so they have been modified extensively over time. The new versions created in the update are aimed at capturing the most common modifications. When it comes to the size of the return expected by an investor (and therefore the amount given up by the company) the most consequential change was moving the valuation cap from pre-money to post-money. In other words, the pre-money valuation cap was intended to show the value of the company before the SAFE converted to equity, whilst the new SAFEs value the company after the SAFE has been converted. 

Why the change from pre- to post-money valuation is important is best outlined with an example. Let us assume a pre-money valuation cap /$ 1 million, and the SAFE investors invested /$ 200,000, the post-money valuation would be /$ 1.2 million following the conversion of the SAFE. Using simple math, this SAFE would effectively purchase 16.67% of the company (/$ 200,000.00/ /$ 1.2 million).

<HighlightBox type="info">

These conversion percentages are typically a best guess and do not account for other variables that come into play like option pool increases, previous investments using other mechanisms, subsequent SAFEs, etc.

</HighlightBox>

This is straightforward if you only had one investor or if all of the investors invested at the same time. However, if you have a number of SAFEs, sold at different times, with different valuation caps it’s difficult to work out what an investor’s final equity stake will be. Using the same math as above, if an additional /$ 300,000 of SAFEs were issued, the post-money valuation would be /$ 1.5 million. The initial /$ 200,000 would now be worth 13.33% (/$ 200,000/ /$ 1.5 million).

<HighlightBox type="info">

In essence, future SAFE purchasers are diluting previous SAFE investors and ultimately defeating one of the core tenants of the SAFE: Transparency. Equally, the previous SAFE made it somewhat difficult for new investors to ascertain what they were purchasing and unsure of their ultimate equity percentage.

</HighlightBox>

This problem is simply solved by using a post-money valuation cap. Investors have a much better idea of the outcome of their investment (assuming conversion at the valuation cap, and not the discount rate). By using a post-money valuation, the investors are less likely to be subject to unanticipated dilution. As an example, using a post-money valuation cap, if the valuation cap was /$ 1 million and an investment of /$ 200,000 was made, the investors now know that this would be equal to 20% (/$ 200,000 / /$1 million). If a future investor comes in for /$ 300,000, unlike the original example, it would not dilute the first investor.
