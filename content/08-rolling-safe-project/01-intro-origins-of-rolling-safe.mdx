Blockchain technology-enabled new financial instruments and mechanisms. It lead to the upcoming of a novel form of finance, decentralized finance (DeFi). In DeFi, instead of relying on third parties (intermediaries) like banks, clearance houses, and exchanges to offer financial instruments, blockchain technology, and specifically smart contracts build the base for new financial mechanisms.

A notable majority of blockchain applications have focused on the financial sector, which can be expected when looking at the number of tokenization projects. This lead to the development of a number of security and other token issuance models to raise capital: initial coin offerings (ICOs), initial exchange offerings (IEOs), security token offerings (STOs) - A colorful parade of acronyms followed.

After the first cryptocurrencies were launched and the first ICO was conducted in 2013, the popularity of ICOs continued growing and led to an ICO bubble in 2017/2018. Still, the bubble burst has in no way curtailed the run on token offerings and DeFi instruments.

These new financial instruments were not only enthusiastically received by investors but became a popular way for start-ups in the industry to finance projects and the development of blockchain-based services. Funding in the blockchain space is often provided by venture capital. Thus, so-called fixed-size equity rounds, seed rounds, or fixed-size series A rounds are common to provide start-ups with the necessary cash flows.

<ExpansionPanel title="Raising capital - Funding mechanisms and start-up financing cycles">

**The start-up financing cycle**

In general, a crucial factor for long-term success when launching a start-up is financing - Start-ups often fail due to cash flow problems. A known issue when starting a business venture.

The revenue of start-ups usually follows a certain **growth development**. In the beginning, start-ups are in the so-called "valley of death": Revenues are not sufficient to result in a profit or even cover costs. Start-ups require seed capital, angel investors, or other forms of equity to roll out their business and develop their service offerings. Once revenues surpass the point where revenue covers the cost (i.e the break-even point), profit is generated. The revenue growth, the slope of the revenue curve, is quite high in the early stage, but then begins to flatten during the latter stage and results in a positive slope that is lower than in the early growth phase. In this revenue growth phase, venture capitalists and other companies looking for strategic alliances, acquisitions, or merger opportunities often provide start-ups with financing to support continued revenue growth.

![Start-up financing cycle](images/startup-financing-cycle.png)

At this point, initial public offerings (IPOs) or initial coin offerings (ICOs) are popular means for further financing. They prepare a company to open up to public markets and to later launch secondary offerings in case more funding is necessary.

Keeping in mind the start-up financing cycle helps understand which funding mechanisms are best suited in which phase of a start-up's venture by reflecting on the growth of revenue over time.

**Conventional funding mechanisms for start-up financing**

In capital structure theory, one often differentiates between **internal and external financing**.

![Traditional forms to raise capital](images/traditionalraisingcapital.png)

**Internal financing** refers to a situation in which a company uses profits as a source of equity by re-investing them instead of distributing the profits among the owners and/or investors (reinvesting profits), or provisions are liquidated. **External financing** describes a situation in which financing of new investments and firm activities is done through external equity. External financing methods are equity issuances such as IPOs and credit financing.

One of the most discussed topics when it comes to blockchain technology and its impact on the financial sector is how companies and projects can raise external capital, especially in the case of start-ups.

When taking a closer look at the investment forms used as funding mechanisms in the early days of a business venture, we will often be faced with four terms: **Convertible notes, seed rounds, preferred stocks, and common stocks**. Let us explore them to better understand the origins of the novel DeFi forms being developed.

_**Convertible notes**_

A convertible note is *a type of bond that can be converted by the holder into some shares of common stock*. It can be understood as a security with debt and equity features.

They are considered a **debt security**, a security entitling holders to the payment of principal and interest because companies agree to a fixed or floating interest rate. Instead of receiving the return of investment plus the interest, investors get a right to convert the equity security in the future. As they are considered securities they fall under regulations such as the [US Securities Act of 1993](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/role-sec/laws-govern-securities-industry#secact1933).

Key characteristics of a convertible note are:

* The main amount is due to the investor at the maturity date;
* Interest accrues at a fixed rate;
* The investor holds a claim on the company's equity senior to the claims of other equity holders and equal to the claims from the non-senior debt.

Convertible note holders receive equity on triggering events like in the case of future equity financing and the sale of the company, as well as when the maturity of the convertible note is reached.

In a start-up financing context, convertible notes are a common option to raise capital at an early stage. Some start-ups also use convertible notes for bridge financing until a later-stage equity round or sale of the company is conducted. In those cases, convertible notes are often referred to as bridge notes.

The increased use of convertible notes by start-ups can be traced back to their time efficiency: Deals for convertible notes can be closed much faster because it is easier to give different investors different prices. This helps alleviate the deadlock potential of investors waiting on other investors to engage before opting to invest (i.e. a "wait-and-see" approach). In fixed-size equity rounds, start-ups have to determine their investment goal (i.e. the minimum funding amount) in advance. This is no longer the case with convertible notes.

_**Seed funding**_

A seed round *is a financing round that raises initial capital to start a business*. It is often raised with convertible notes due to the difficulty of setting a specific valuation on an early venture. Startups frequently have more than one seed round of funding.

<HighlightBox type="info">

Wonder why it is called seed round and you gather seed capital? It is called seed because a seed round takes place very early in a company's existence (i.e. before it generates cash flows). Remember the start-up financing cycle? Seed rounds are typically done in the "Valley of Death".

</HighlightBox>

Seed rounds are ideal for start-ups with a developed business idea but in need of liquidity to maintain or expand operations, so to say to keep things running. A majority of start-ups engage in funding rounds to receive external capital. Seed funding helps a company grow its business. A seed round is the first equity funding of a start-up. Often seed funding is followed by further funding rounds - so-called Series A, B, and C rounds.

Investors can engage through these rounds early on in exchange for equity or a part of the company's ownership. A common investor type in seed funding is the so-called angel investor - An investor that engages in riskier business ventures like start-ups to receive equity stake (i.e. percentage of the company's ownership) or convertible note.

_**Common and preferred stock**_

There are **two types of equity or stock**:

* Preferred stock, and
* Common stock.

Whereas, **common stock/shares** are *securities representing ownership in a company* and are recorded in the equity section of a company's balance sheet. Common stockholders elect the board of directors and vote on corporate policies, i.e. they have voting rights. In case of a liquidation event, common shareholders' claims on assets are fulfilled after bondholders, preferred shareholders, and other debtholders are fully paid. Thus, common stock is riskier than for example, debt or preferred stock. Still common stock usually performs better than bonds and preferred stocks (long-term).

To issue common stock, a company first conducts an initial public offering (IPO) with the help of an underwriting investment bank. The bank determines the type of stock and its price. After the IPO, the purchase of stock is open to the public in secondary markets.

**Preferred stock/shares** refers to *equity of stockholders with a higher claim to dividends or asset distribution than common stockholders*. In the case of liquidation, the asset claim of preferred stockholders also takes precedence over common stockholders but follows that of bondholders. This type of stockholder has no or only limited voting rights when it comes to the company's governance. The details of each preferred stock depend on the terms defined by the company as long as it follows laws and regulations. The majority of preferred stock issued has no or a very distant maturity date. 

Usually, the value of preferred stock does not have the same potential of growth compared to common stock. In some instances, preferred stockholders can convert their stock for a number of common shares. The investors' gain depends on the market price.

Preferred stock has characteristics of both bonds and common stock. As with bonds, preferred stock results in higher dividends, a higher asset claims in case of liquidation, and can include a right to redeem shares at a pre-fixed price and date. Similar to common stock, preferred stock is a form of equity funding. At the same time, preferred stockholders receive fixed dividends, an increase/decrease of price does not affect preferred stockholders as much as common stockholders, and preferred stockholders do not have voting rights as is the case for common stockholders.

A new promising form of financial instruments is the **Rolling Simple Agreement for Future Equity (Rolling SAFE)**. Startups issue Rolling SAFEs to raise funds from investors using a smart contract. In its **initial phase**, the terms of the offering are set. Then before reaching the minimum funding goal (MFG) set during the initial phase, the **pre-MFG phase**, investors buy tokens through a smart contract called a Decentralized Autonomous Trust (DAT) at a set fixed price. The funds collected are put in escrow. Once the **MFG is reached**, the smart contract moves a portion of the funds into a reserve and sends the rest to the issuing organization to fund its operations. The reserve helps make sure investors can sell tokens back to the DAT at any time. During the **post-MFG phase**, a pre-defined share of the revenues of the issuing organization is added to the reserve annually. As the funds in the reserve increase, the buying and selling price of the tokens increase as well, and new tokens are issued based on predetermined formulas. **Termination** results from a triggering event such as an IPO or a liquidation. During the **termination phase**, the smart contract buys back all the tokens still in circulation, and investors receive equity proportionally to the number of tokens held.

Let's dive into the specifics of a Rolling SAFE by taking a look at its predecessor, the SAFE.

## The origin of Rolling SAFEs: A simple agreement for future equity

A simple agreement for future equity (SAFE) can be defined as *an agreement between a company/the issuer and investors providing the latter with rights to the company's future equity*. A SAFE is a convertible security: An investor provides a company with funding to in the future be able to convert their investment into ownership in the company.

In 2013, [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), a US-American technology start-up accelerator, released the first SAFE. The first SAFE by Y Combinator allowed start-ups to raise funds before conducting a priced financing round like a series A preferred stock round. It was introduced as a simpler, more founder-friendly **alternative to convertible notes** with low transaction costs (i.e. costs related to any economic trade when participating in a market) to assist businesses with initial/early-stage funding by attracting early investors. As fundraising by start-ups changed towards raising higher liquidity through seed rounds, which no longer served as a preparation for later priced financing rounds but main funding for projects and operations, Y Combinator upgraded its SAFE in 2018 to become a post-money SAFE to:

* Reflect the change of use from a SAFE being an instrument combined with later priced investment rounds to a standalone instrument for large amounts of funding,
* Make it easier for investors to understand how much of a companies ownership they are acquiring, and
* Make it easier for start-ups to assess the dilution potential of their funding instruments.

The pre-money and post-money SAFEs are different regarding the valuation cap. The valuation cap is based on post-money value, meaning the timing of the valuation is different. For post-money valuations, later investments into the company are considered. In addition, pro-rate rights became optional. The right given to an investor that allows them to maintain their initial level of ownership percentage during later financing rounds became optional in post-money SAFEs. The rate only applies during the first conversion round of SAFE shares to equity.

</HighlightBox>

With a SAFE, the investor shares are not valued at the time the share agreement is signed. Instead, the company and investor determine the mechanism for the issuance of future shares and defer actual valuation. Investors receive their future shares once a **triggering event**, such as a priced investment round or a liquidity event, occurs. Thus, negotiated conditions usually relate to the valuation cap and/or a discount for the share valuation when the triggering event occurs.

A SAFE is a securities offering in which investors receive an equity stake or convertible note stake in a company for their investment. As such, SAFEs were envisioned to help start-ups until they can generate revenue through their business operations or receive further investments. While a start-up does not generate any profit, i.e. the revenue is lower than the (running) costs, a SAFE can help to raise initial funding.

SAFEs are usually terminated in the case of:

* An equity round,
* An acquisition,
* An initial public offering (IPO), or
* The company going out of business (insolvency or bankruptcy).

In case of a liquidity event (like an acquisition) taking place before a priced equity round, the investors of a SAFE can either receive back their original investment amount or convert their SAFE shares into common stock at a valuation based on the valuation cap set. In case the company goes out of business, there is a dissolution of the SAFE and the investors receive their money back.

In which way is a SAFE different from a convertible note?

SAFEs are similar to convertible notes, but are not a debt instrument; A SAFE is similar to a warrant and not a loan. Thus, a SAFE **does not have a maturity date or accruing interest**. The SAFE remains outstanding as long as a conversion/triggering event has not occurred. At the same time, investors receive a right to convert their SAFE into equity, and the price of equity is lower than the one investors in later funding rounds receive due to discount rates and/or valuation caps. If a company issues a more favorable instrument than the SAFE, it would need to inform the holders of a SAFE, so that they can decide to transform/convert their SAFE (i.e. fixed equity) to this more attractive instrument. SAFEs were designed to replace convertible notes as a simplified investment instrument for (pre-)angel investors wanting to translate their investment to an equity stake with preferential pricing when preferred stock is issued in a first priced investment round.

SAFEs do not have any **size requirements** when it comes to conversion. The SAFE converts at **any** equity investment.

Additionally, SAFEs are usually not subject to the regulations on debt mechanisms. This adds to their simplicity and makes SAFEs easier to conduct, compared to convertible notes. It also makes SAFEs less costly, as legal costs and negotiation time are reduced.

### An example: SAFE with a valuation cap and discount

SAFEs typically either have a valuation cap and/or a discount, meaning there are four main forms. Let us take a closer look at how a SAFE with a valuation cap and one with a discount would look like.

The **valuation cap** is an indicator of the maximum valuation allowed in an investment round. So to say, a valuation cap is the maximum amount at which a SAFE converts. A SAFE with a valuation cap translates into an offering where any valuation increase above the cap does not affect the price of the equity SAFE holders get. Whereas, the lower the valuation cap, the more beneficial it is for investors as investors get more equity stake during conversion.

For example, let us say a company's SAFE has a valuation cap of $1 million. If the round closes with a valuation of $2 million, the SAFE holder still receives equity as if the valuation would only be $ 1 million because of the valuation cap. Without the valuation cap of $1 million, the investor would receive twice as much equity for its SAFE shares as the valuation of all SAFE shares is twice as high (from originally $1 million to $2 million).

In a SAFE, **discount** refers to the amount by which the cost of equity decreases when shares are converted to equity. A SAFE's discount applies to the priced investment round valuation for SAFE holders during conversion to equity. Whereas, the higher the discount, the more shares an investor can convert to equity.

A company wants to offer a discount rate to make the SAFE more attractive for investors. The company (issuer of the SAFE) sets a discount rate of 20%, which is common for investment rounds. Which effect has a 20% discount rate? Say an investor allocates $100 to buy SAFE shares in the next investment round that has a $1 price-per-share. The investor can convert his $100 worth of SAFE shares to 125 shares of equity because of the 20% discount rate, which results in a $0.80 price-per-share instead of a $1 price-per-share. The investor receives 125 shares instead of 100 due to the discount.

In summary, key parameters of a SAFE are:

* **Valuation cap:** Is there a valuation cap? If there is one, what is the valuation cap?
* **Discount:** Is there a discount for SAFE investors when shares are converted to equity as a result of a triggering event?

Valuation caps and discounts can potentially create high dilution in cases where start-ups perform multiple SAFE and convertible note rounds.

### How useful is a SAFE?

SAFEs are well-suited to the needs of start-ups. Two aspects make them very attractive: high-resolution financing and simpler negotiations. A SAFE is a high-resolution fundraising opportunity, which provides founders and investors with more certainty and transparency, as well as reduced legal costs and negotiation time. The negotiation time is reduced significantly as only a few terms have to be negotiated by the investor and company, and there are templates companies can use to issue a SAFE. At the same time, SAFEs created the opportunity of accessing equity at very favorable terms for investors, while companies get faster access to funds and benefit from increased flexibility. The valuation of a company is delayed as is with any convertible security. This can also help minimize dilution.

Although SAFEs presented start-ups with a novel and very useful funding mechanism, they also bear one major issue for investors: What happens if you have to wait a very long time to convert your SAFE shares to equity? As SAFEs do not have a maturity date, the issuer company does not have a very strong incentive to get a priced investment round started, especially if the funding from the SAFE is sufficient for the business. This can lead to investors waiting for a conversion for quite a while. Additionally, valuation caps without discounts in SAFEs can result in SAFE investors receiving the same terms as later investors in the end. Moreover, investors do not earn interest with SAFEs. This might not be of much relevance for short-running SAFEs, but is a significant difference when SAFEs run long. Then costs of lost interest can become significant.

Company owners and founders should also carefully consider the issuance of SAFEs as they bear the potential of dilution during the conversion. Dilution can lead to owners underestimating the degree of control they lose through the investment rounds. This is where the Rolling SAFE comes in.

<HighlightBox type="tip">

A simple formula for equity dilution founders can review to better assess the ownership dilution stemming from SAFEs is:

**Equity dilution = SAFE amount/valuation cap**

Let us take a look at the formula and ownership dilution with an example. Imagine a company issuing a SAFE with a valuation cap of $1 million. Only $100.000 is raised with the SAFE. What does this mean regarding equity dilution?

The equity dilution is 0.10 or 10%. So to say, in effect 10% of the company's ownership is sold with the SAFE and its conversion.

What happens if the SAFE raises less or more? In case the SAFE only raised $ 50.000, the equity dilution is 0.05 or 5%. Now, if the SAFE raised $200.000, the equity dilution becomes 0.20 or 20%.

When keeping the valuation cap constant, the less the SAFE raises (the lower the SAFE amount), the lower the equity dilution is. At the same time, the more a SAFE raises (the higher the SAFE amount), the higher the equity dilution is. Meaning, the company's loss in ownership is strongly linked to the amount raised by a SAFE.
