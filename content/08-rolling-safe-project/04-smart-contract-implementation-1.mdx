B9lab's sample project is an implementation of a continiuous programmable equity offering also known as a Rolling SAFE. To see the implementation in action, please visit the [TZMINT web application](https://tzmint.b9lab.com/), which is hosted by [B9lab](https://b9lab.com/). It is better to first try out the web application before taking a closer look at the implementation described in this course.

Before working on this section, make sure to go through the [introduction section](./what-is-a-cso) to understand the underlying mechanisms of this novel funding instrument.

For a close look at the formulas for calculation, we recommend consulting the [Continuous Organizations Whitepaper](https://github.com/C-ORG/whitepaper#annex) by Thibauld Favre. In this section, we will present an implementation of the ideas in the whitepaper, our TZMINT project.

We implemented our smart contract in [SmartPy](https://smartpy.io/). To keep things simple, the tokens are represented as a simple map. In addition, we will store everything we want to keep track of on-chain:

```python
       self.init(
            organization       = organization,                                     # contract administrator
            ledger             = sp.map(l = {organization: sp.as_nat(preminted)}), # token ledger
            price              = initial_price,                                    # initial price before MFG
            total_tokens       = preminted,
            burned_tokens      = burned_tokens,
            MFG                = MFG,                                              # minimal funding goal
            MPT                = sp.timestamp(...),                                # minimum period of time
            b                  = b,                                                # buy slope
            s                  = s,                                                # sell slope
            I                  = I,                # percentage of the funds being held in the cash reserve
            D                  = D,                # percentage of the revenues being funneled into cash reserve
            minimumInvestment  = minimumInvestment,
            company_v          = company_valuation,
            base_currency      = base_currency,
            total_allocation   = total_allocation,
            stake_allocation   = stake_allocation, 
            termination_events = termination_events,
            govRights          = govRights,
            company_name       = company_name,
            phase              = 0,                                                # starting under MFG
            total_investment   = sp.tez(0)
            )
```

Need a recap on SmartPy? No worries! We recommend a look at the chapter [Writing Smart Contracts](./smart-contracts).

</HighlightBox>

## Contract entrypoints

The contract has **five entrypoints**:

* `buy`,
* `sell`,
* `pay`,
* `burn`, and
* `close`.

In this section, we will begin with an explanation of the `buy` and the `pay` functions. Afterwards, in the [next section](./cso-smart-contract-implementation-part-2), we will talk about the `sell` and `close` functions (closing function). 

<HighlightBox type="info">

You can find the smart contract in the [project repository](https://github.com/b9lab/tezos-cso-project).

</HighlightBox>

If you want to extend this smart contract to, for example, fulfill the FA2 token standard, you will need to implement additional entrypoints. You can find more information regarding the token standard in the [FA2](./fa2) section.

## The `buy` function

`buy` will calculate the number of tokens for the sent amount of tez and it will mint these tokens. In addition, it should send back the excess amount.

There are **two phases** in the offering regarding the buy price:

1. The **initial phase**: Before the minimum funding goal (MFG) is reached, the buy price is constant; 
2. The **slopy phase** (i.e. post-MFG phase): Once the MFG is reached, the buy price will increase for each issued token.

<HighlightBox type="tip">

If these phases do not sound familiar, take another look at the [introduction section](./what-is-a-cso), especially _Stages in a Rolling SAFE_.

</HighlightBox>

## The buy price

The buy price is determined during the **initial phase** by the following lines in the contract code:

```python
    # initial phase, the price is fix
    def buy_initial(self, amount):
        # calculate amount of tokens from sp.amount and the price
        token_amount = sp.local(
            "token_amount", 
            sp.ediv(
                amount, 
                self.data.price
                ).open_some("Fatal Error: Price is zero")
            )
```

In this phase, the calculation is `token_amount = amount/self.data.price`, where `amount` represents the number of tokens (in tez) sent with the transaction and `self.data.price` is the current price of the token.

After the calculation, `buy_initial` will check if any tokens can be issued. Then it will add the calculated number of tokens to the ledger linking them to the transaction sender. In case no record of the user exists, it will create an entry. The comments in the code should be sufficient as an explanation:

```python
        # fail if no tokens can be issued with this amount of tez
        sp.if sp.fst(token_amount.value) == sp.as_nat(0):
            sp.failwith("No token can be issued, please send more tez")
            
        # check if the address owns tokens
        sp.if self.data.ledger.contains(sp.sender):
            # add amount of the tokens into the ledger
            self.data.ledger[sp.sender] += sp.fst(token_amount.value)
        sp.else:
            # put amount of the tokens into the ledger
            self.data.ledger[sp.sender] = sp.fst(token_amount.value)
            
        # increase total amount of the tokens
        self.data.total_tokens += sp.fst(token_amount.value)

        # keep received funds in this contract as buyback reserve
        # but send back the excess
        sp.if sp.utils.mutez_to_nat(sp.snd(token_amount.value)) > 0:
            sp.send(sp.sender, sp.snd(token_amount.value))

        # track how much is invested
        self.data.total_investment = self.data.total_investment + amount - sp.snd(token_amount.value)
```

Before calculating the recent value of the total investments, the excess is calculated and sent back to the user.

Now, let us have a look at the **post-MFG phase**, so to say the "slopy phase" for the `buy` function:

```python
    # after initial phase, the price will increase
    def buy_slope(self, amount):
        # calculate amount of tokens from amount of tez
        # see https://github.com/C-ORG/whitepaper#buy-calculus

        token_amount = sp.local(
            "token_amount", 
            self.square_root(
                2 * sp.utils.mutez_to_nat(amount) /self.data.b + 
                self.data.total_tokens * self.data.total_tokens
                ) - self.data.total_tokens
            )

        tez_amount = sp.local(
            "tez_amount",
            sp.as_nat(token_amount.value) * self.data.total_tokens * self.data.b   /2 + 
            (sp.as_nat(token_amount.value) + self.data.total_tokens) * sp.as_nat(token_amount.value) * self.data.b/2
            )

        send_back = sp.local(
            "send_back",
            amount - sp.utils.nat_to_mutez(tez_amount.value)
            )
```

This time the calculation for the `token_amount` is more complex because of the linear price increase. We have to calculate the [area of the triangle](https://github.com/C-ORG/whitepaper#buy-calculus) under the price function.

![Calculating the buy price post-MFG](/images/buy-calculus.png)

You can find the same calculation in the [Javascript code](https://github.com/b9lab/tezos-cso-project) too.

Next, the contract does a **reserve-calculation** to determine the amount of the excess, which we send back in the next lines:

```python
        # send tez that is too much
        sp.if sp.utils.mutez_to_nat(send_back.value) > 0:
            sp.send(sp.sender, send_back.value)

        # track how much is invested
        self.data.total_investment += sp.utils.nat_to_mutez(tez_amount.value)

        # fail if no tokens can be issued with this amount of tez
        sp.if sp.as_nat(token_amount.value) == sp.as_nat(0):
            sp.failwith("No token can be issued, please send more tez")
            
        # calculate buyback reserve from amount I*amount/100
        buyback_reserve = sp.local(
            "buyback_reserve", 
            sp.utils.nat_to_mutez(self.data.I * tez_amount.value / sp.as_nat(100))
            )
        
        company_pay = sp.local(
            "company_pay",
            amount - buyback_reserve.value
            )

        # send (100-I) * amount/100 of the received tez to the organization
        sp.send(self.data.organization, company_pay.value)
        # this will keep I * amount/100 in this contract as buyback reserve
            
        # check if the address owns tokens
        sp.if self.data.ledger.contains(sp.sender):
            self.data.ledger[sp.sender] += sp.as_nat(token_amount.value)
        sp.else:
            self.data.ledger[sp.sender] = sp.as_nat(token_amount.value)
                 
        # increase total amount of the tokens
        self.data.total_tokens += sp.as_nat(token_amount.value)

        # set new price
        self.data.price = sp.utils.nat_to_mutez(self.data.b * self.data.total_tokens)
        self.modify_sell_slope(send_back.value + company_pay.value)
```

Each time someone buys a token, a part of the tez amount in the transaction will be kept for the buyback reserve.

<HighlightBox type="info">

At the end of a `buy_slope` call, the contract updates the sell slope. This is something we address in the [next section](./cso-smart-contract-implementation-part-2).

</HighlightBox>

## Entrypoint

Now we can look at the `buy` entrypoint and understand the conditions for calling the initial or slope buy function:

```python
    # buy some tokens with sender's tez
    @sp.entry_point
    def buy(self):
    #check the phase, dont sell or buy if closed
        sp.if self.data.phase != 2:
            # if token in intialization phase, the price is fixed and all funds are escrowed
            sp.if self.data.total_investment < self.data.MFG:
                # check the excess above MFG and send back
                sp.if sp.utils.mutez_to_nat(self.data.MFG - sp.amount - self.data.total_investment) < 0:
                    sp.send(sp.sender, sp.amount - self.data.MFG + self.data.total_investment)
                    self.buy_initial(self.data.MFG - self.data.total_investment)
                sp.else:
                    self.buy_initial(sp.amount)
            # if initialization phase is past
            sp.else:
                self.data.phase = 1
                self.buy_slope(sp.amount)
```

You can see, that we do not allow any action to take place after the closing phase.

## Handling excess in the buy function

We do an additional check for the **excess**, which gets sent back. The excess in the `buy` function is a different one than the excess in the `buy_initial` and `buy_slope` functions.

We check for excess in two different instances:

* The excess in the `buy` function;
* The excess in the `buy_initial` and `buy_slope` function.

The excess check in the `buy` function makes sure one buy transaction does not surpass the MFG. The excess in the `buy_initial` and `buy_slope` function calculates the excess amount of tez after a buy transaction, so to say, your change.

_Why do we differentiate when it comes to excesses?_

Imagine a scenario where a user (investor) commits a large amount to buy tokens. Due to the investment being very large the MFG is technically reached and surpassed with the investor's one transaction. How should the contract react?

To avoid this issue, the contract checks in which phase the buy transaction falls. In the above-described scenario, it would not accept the transaction for the whole investment amount. Instead, the investor receives all tokens that can be bought for the initial-phase price and an excess return, with which more tokens can be bought but at the price determined by the `buy` function.

We want to differentiate between the initial and the post-MFG phase, so that the contract only allows to buy tokens at the initial price until the MFG is reached. The user will need another call to continue to buy but at the post-MFG phase price.

## The `pay` function

A customer can call the `pay()` entrypoint to send a payment to the organization via the smart contract. If `pay()` is called, the smart contract will issue new tokens and by default send them to the organization. Optionally, the customer can pass an address to which the tokens are sent. A pre-determined part of the received tez will be kept in the reserve and the rest will be sent to the organization.

We will allow payments in the slopy phase:

```python
   @sp.entry_point
    def pay(self):
        # check that the initial phase is over but not closed
        sp.verify(self.data.phase == 1)
        # see https://github.com/C-ORG/whitepaper#-revenues---pay
        buyback_reserve = sp.local(
            "local_amount", 
            sp.utils.nat_to_mutez(
                sp.utils.mutez_to_nat(sp.amount) * self.data.D / 100
                )
            )
        # send sp.amount - buyback_reserve to organization
        d = sp.amount - buyback_reserve.value
        sp.send(self.data.organization, d)

        # create the same amount of tokens a buy call would do
        token_amount = sp.local(
        "token_amount", 
        self.square_root(
            2 * sp.utils.mutez_to_nat(d) /self.data.b + 
            self.data.total_tokens * self.data.total_tokens
            ) - self.data.total_tokens
        )

        # give those tokes to the organisation
        self.data.ledger[self.data.organization] = sp.as_nat(token_amount.value)
                
        # increase total amount of the tokens
        self.data.total_tokens += sp.as_nat(token_amount.value)
```

As you can see, it will mint the same number of tokens as if `buy()` would have been called. A part of the tez sent with the call will be kept in the contract:

```python
        # send sp.amount - buyback_reserve to organization
        d = sp.amount - buyback_reserve.value
        sp.send(self.data.organization, d)
```

Let us now take a look at the `sell` function.
