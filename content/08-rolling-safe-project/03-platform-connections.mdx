<ExpansionPanel title="Prerequisit - Building a web application with the Tezos ecosystem">

This section addresses system components of the TZMINT web application. The application builds, among others, on:

* [Beacon](/beacon),
* [Taquito](./taquito), and
* [TzKT](./tzkt).

[Beacon](https://www.walletbeacon.io/) offers an interface to connect browser, mobile, desktop, web, and/or hardware wallets with an application. Several wallets are supported by the Beacon SDK: [AirGap](https://airgap.it/), [Galleon](https://github.com/Cryptonomic/Deployments/wiki/Galleon:-Releases), [Kukai](https://wallet.kukai.app/), [Temple](https://templewallet.com/), and [Spire](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spire/gpfndedineagiepkpinficbcbbgjoenn). Thus, we used Beacon for the communication between a number of wallets and the TZMINT web application.

The wrappers are used to fetch contract and transaction data and to call the contract. The following wrappers were used:

* `chainWrapper`: Uses the [TzKT API](./tzkt) to fetch blockchain data, formats, and caches, and to calculate values;
* `walletWrapper`: Uses the Beacon SDK to sign the transactions;
* `contractWrapper`: Uses `walletWrapper` to sign the transactions and Taquito to send transactions to the Tezos node.

The component that brings the TZMINT web application and the Tezos blockchain together is the `DataHandler`. It requests the data the web application needs with `chainWrapper` and uses the `contractWrapper` to buy and sell tokens.
