The wrappers are used to fetch contract and transaction data and to call the contract. The following wrappers were used:

* `chainWrapper`: Uses the TzKT API to fetch blockchain data, formats, and cashes and to calculate values;
* `walletWrapper`: Uses the Beacon SDK to sign the transactions;
* `contractWrapper`: Uses `walletWrapper` to sign the transactions and Taquito to send transactions to the Tezos node.

The component that brings the TZMINT web application and the Tezos blockchain together is the `DataHandler`. It requests the data the web application needs with `chainWrapper` and uses the `contractWrapper` to buy and sell tokens.
