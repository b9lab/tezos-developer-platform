As a reaction to start-ups frequently increasing the target amount of funding for early investment instruments like SAFEs, convertible notes, and seed rounds as well as focusing on early investment instruments as a primary funding source without planning and performing follow-up investment rounds, so-called rolling simple agreements for future equity (Rolling SAFEs) were developed as continuous offerings.

Generally speaking, a Rolling SAFE is a continuous and flexible fundraising mechanism. It consists of a security token offering that represents a proportional share of the future equity of a company. The token does not represent a percentual share of the ownership of the company, as in the case of traditional shares, but rather a claim on expected future equity. The promise of a Rolling SAFE is based on a company's current business performance and on the capability of a company to translate its business success into fundraising success.

Rolling SAFEs are blockchain-enabled **continuous** offerings of a **programmable equity**. The future equity claims are backed by a reserve and securitized in a certain token amount. The issuance, distribution, price calculation, and even buyback of tokens are automated and programmed. Equity becomes programmable through automatable and scalable mechanisms implemented in a smart contract.

<ExpansionPanel title="What is a programmable equity (PEQ)?">

Programmable equity (PEQ) is a term for a technology-enabled financing mechanism based on an equity claim issuance. Through it, the interests of stakeholders are aligned with the financial success of a company - Investors are interested in the financial success as their claim and with their return on investment (ROI) is linked to it.

PEQ offerings help create liquidity fast by tokenizing tradeable company shares allowing for high-resolution financing.

The main idea behind programmable equity, as the name already discloses, is offering equity without having to give up control over ownership and the decision-making rights that come with it. At the same time, PEQ offerings provide investors the opportunity to better and more transparently assess risk as the offering is programmed and largely automatized.

A Rolling SAFE is a form of high-resolution fundraising, as it is much faster than, for example, a fixed-equity round - there is no need for pitches, negotiations, and intermediaries. It is a way to get liquidity fast. The time-investment to set up a Rolling SAFE is also much lower because the issuer can offer different prices for different investors without having to negotiate each investment individually. It is all automated through one offering. Rolling SAFEs present a good alternative to convertible notes because they help liquidity markets evolve towards high-resolution. Rolling SAFEs are alternatives to fixed-size equity rounds, as they are more flexible and less time-intensive.

In addition, Rolling SAFEs allow founders to maintain long-term control and ownership over their company, while they provide investors with greater transparency when it comes to the offering and price development of their tokens. Here Rolling SAFEs can be differentiated from traditional SAFEs.

Market psychological group dynamics are less strong for Rolling SAFEs because investors are individually incentivized to align their interests with the company's interest of being a successful business. In addition, investors are incentivized to invest early and not take a "wait-and-see" approach to decide on when to invest. The return on investment (ROI) is higher the earlier an investor buys tokens.

SAFEs and Rolling SAFEs share similarities conceptually but are two different investment instruments. As with SAFEs, Rolling SAFEs do not have a maturity date or accruing interests. One of the most essential differences is that a SAFE indirectly represents a claim of ownership as investors convert SAFEs to equity stake, while a Rolling SAFE token only represents a claim for future revenues of the company (i.e. when a company creates profit and with it cash flows). The focus moves from equity stake/shares to the future performance of a company. With this change, the incentivization for investors changes too. A Rolling SAFE is seen as a mechanism assisting with aligning investor interests with those of the company. At the same time, the instrument is tailored to early investors.

Additionally, Rolling SAFEs can be set to not rely on further investment/equity rounds as they can run as a continuous offering for as long as intended by the company. Whereas, investors can drop out and redeem their investment if they want to pull out. It is envisioned to be more than "just" an early investment instrument. For this reason, it is also suited for large target funding amounts.

The degree of assessable risk also increases in Rolling SAFEs: Founders do not have to fear equity dilution (i.e. their ownership being diluted) and investors can easier calculate margins and gains, as well as dilution due to an increase in transparency and the programmability of this form of equity funding. The backing by reserves managed by a smart contract adds additional investor security when it comes to buybacks but also the value development of the security.

Rolling SAFEs open up new liquidity markets for start-ups and present a new investment opportunity to a wider investor base - They are not bound to a specific market environment and usually do not present with access barriers, so to say, everyone can buy a Rolling SAFE token. Rolling SAFEs give investors improved access to benefit from the financial success of a company while providing young businesses with a possibility to have a running continuous security offering providing funding.

## Stages in a Rolling SAFE

To better understand the funding mechanism, let us take a closer look at the different stages of a Rolling SAFE.

The continuous offering - continuous because tokens are offered continuously to investors - of a Rolling SAFE can be split into **four stages**:

* Initialization,
* Pre-MFG,
* Post-MFG, and
* Termination.

### Initialization

During the **initialization**, the issuer (i.e. a company) decides on the terms of the offering, especially by:

* Setting the annual revenue committed to the reserve, 
* Determining the company valuation, and
* Setting a minimum threshold for the funding and running time of the offering.

<ExpansionPanel title="What is the reserve in a Rolling SAFE?">

Once the MFG is met, the bonding curve begins its work. The smart contract issues tokens, which represent a financial right (claim) on the cash reserve. This reserve is managed by the smart contract and reflects the organization's revenues. So to say, the token represents a claim on the equity of the organization.

When the organization begins to generate revenue, part of the revenue goes into the buyback reserve. In addition, the revenue begins to drive the price of the token. This mechanism creates a clear incentive for investors to hold on to their tokens until the organization begins to generate revenues and the price begins to rise.

The reserve allows for the bonding curve to act as an automated market maker. Because of the bonding curve, tokens can be bought or sold at any point in time, as the reserve holds enough funds to buy the tokens back.

</ExpansionPanel>

The running time can be indefinite and always be increased, but never decreased. The annual amount committed to the reserve helps decrease the risk for investors, as the reserve is used to finance token buys and the buyback at termination.

<HighlightBox type="tip">

Check out the *Termination* stage description for more details on the buyback.

For a closer look at the different functions used in a Rolling SAFE and how they relate to price, token amount, and the reserve, as well as at how the issuer can influence the price, just scroll down to *Rolling SAFE functions: Influencing the token price* at the end of this section.

</HighlightBox>

The higher the annual amount is, the less risky the offerings are for investors because the buyback at termination (i.e. when the tokens convert to equity) is ensured. Then the issuer only has to deploy a smart contract for the Rolling SAFE to begin.

In a Rolling SAFE, a **smart contract** issues the tokenized security handles sales and buybacks, and assists with funneling the annually committed revenue. This smart contract is often called the **decentralized autonomous trust (DAT)**.

![The relationship between investor, DAT, and issuer](images/DAT.png)

The DAT issues token proportionally to the amount invested. The DAT tokens represent a claim on the DAT-managed cash reserve.

### Pre-MFG

The issuer sets a target amount of investment, the so-called **minimum funding goal (MFG)**. As long as the MFG is not met and the offering is in a so-called **pre-MFG** stage, tokens are minted proportionally to the amount held by the reserve. All tokens are offered at a fixed price and all funds received through token sales are escrowed by the DAT.

The initial, fixed price gives investors a threshold under which the price will never fall and helps reward early investors over those investing at a later time. Investors can withdraw their investment and receive 100% of it back, e.g. tokens can be redeemed and are then taken out of circulation. Thus, the MFG increases investor protection. In addition, the offering can be canceled by the issuer during this phase.

### Post-MFG

Once the MFG is reached, the offering can no longer be canceled, only closed, i.e. terminated. It remains active at a minimum for as long as the running time was set. A large part of the MFG funds moves into the cash reserve and the other part goes to the issuer company. The portion of the revenue moved into the cash reserve is determined by the reserve percentage set during initialization. Investor funding is no longer escrowed in the DAT reserve, as during the pre-MFG phase - Investors no longer withdraw and then receive 100% of their investment back, but instead can sell their tokens at the price determined by the bonding curve.

**Post-MFG**, the smart contract/DAT manages the token issuance and the reserve reflecting the amount allocated by the issuer to the cash reserve. When the issuer generates revenues, part of it goes into the reserve to finance the buyback at termination. This creates an incentive for investors to at least hold on to their tokens for as long as the issuer has not begun to generate revenue because the token price begins to increase with generated revenue. Ideally, investors hold on to their tokens until the offering is closed - when they can expect the highest ROI. Whereas, the bonding curve acts as an automated market maker so that tokens can be sold and bought at a calculated price at any point in time. The cash reserve ensures this by holding enough funds to buy back tokens.

The price of tokens is determined by a **bonding curve**. It creates a mathematically-based way to enable coordination and incentivization of investors. The bonding curve consists of a **buy and sell curve**, both determined by two functions. At this point, the price for buying back tokens is determined by the bonding curve. Thus, investors can no longer withdraw their investment and receive 100% of it back, i.e. sell their tokens for the same price they bought them.

![Buy and sell function](images/price-function.png)

The price of the tokens is automated and non-negotiable. The **initial price**, pre-MFG, was based on the company valuation and is calculated by an algorithm. The **post-MFG price** is based on a function of the number of tokens issued and sold. The higher the token amount, the higher the price. Moreover, the implied valuation is that of one growing over time with more funds being raised. Being an early investor does have value, as the price per token rises with the overall amount of tokens. For example, compare the price per token an early investor pays pre-MFG with the price per token after the MFG is met.

![Buy price development over time](images/price-time.png)

How is the price determined post-MFG? And how are buy and sell prices differ from each other?

* The **buy function** implements a linear relationship between the buy price and the number of tokens.
* The **sell function** is influenced by the cash reserve. To control the sell price, the issuer can use `pay()` and `burn()` functions to influence the reserve and with it control the sell price.

While the offering is active, tokens are issued proportionally to the amount in the reserve, so token holders can buy and sell tokens for market prices or sell them directly back to the reserve (i.e. tokens can be redeemed).

How does a Rolling SAFE end?

### Termination

Rolling SAFEs are envisioned to be closed in two different ways:

* Closure due to liquidity or dissolution events, or
* Termination at the end of the running time.

When the company, for example, is sold or an IPO is conducted, the triggering event leads to the offering ending and investors being entitled to receive equity in proportion to their investment (i.e. number of tokens). Thus, a conversion to equity before the termination of the offering is conducted.

Concerning the termination, the issuer could let the offering run indefinitely, but usually, a running time is set and at the end of it the offering is terminated. Termination is possible as soon as a minimum period of time, as defined during initialization, has passed. The defined minimum period of time gives investors more transparency on the offering.

A Rolling SAFE is terminated once:

* The issuer pays an **exit fee** to the smart contract to buy back all tokens from investors - The fee equals the current issuance price of tokens multiplied with the number of outstanding tokens (tokens held by investors),
* The offering is closed, and
* All investors receive a payment in return for their tokens, e.g. all outstanding tokens are bought back with the funds held in the reserve and coming from the exit fee.

<HighlightBox type="info">

Why is the exit fee a fee? A fee per se is defined as *a fixed price paid for services or rights*. Fees are common in business transactions.

In the case of a Rolling SAFE, the exit fee is the fee the issuer pays to buy back tokens, i.e. get back all issued tokens by buying them back from tokenholders to terminate the offering. It can be considered a fee as the issuer is required to buy back **all** tokens that are still in circulation at the same time. So to say, the issuer pays a fixed price to terminate the offering.

</HighlightBox>

The termination of a Rolling SAFE resembles a traditional buyback of shares. All tokens are bought back at the same price.

Before diving into more details on how Rolling SAFEs present an investment instrument with fixed dilution, let us take a closer look at how a company can "manipulate" the price of a Rolling SAFE token.

## Rolling SAFE functions: Influencing the token price

Once the offering is launched, the price is automated and non-negotiable. The initial price is based on the valuation of the company. After an initial period when the minimum funding goal is met, the price is based on a function of the number of issued tokens and the number of tokens bought (the invested amount).

**The more tokens issued, the higher the price.** The earlier an investment takes place the more tokens the investor receives, as the price per token rises with the increasing number of tokens. Whereby, the **amount of capital** is per se unlimited. The equity allocation of the continuous Rolling SAFE offering can be increased but never decreased.

The **buy price** is determined by the number of tokens, as the buy function implements a linear relationship between the buy price and the number of tokens. The **sell price** is influenced by the reserve. To control the sell price, the company (issuer) can use **`pay()` and `burn()` functions** to influence the reserve and with it **control the sell price**.

There are mainly **four functions** in a Rolling SAFE:

* **`sell()` function**,
* **`pay()` function**,
* **`buy()` function**, and
* **`burn()` function**.

The **`sell()` function** is called by investors to sell their tokens for the base currency. Technically, the function is part of the smart contract, which receives the tokens, burns them, and sends back the correct amount of base currency (i.e. the currency against which the exchange rate is quoted) to the investor from the smart contract's cash reserve - unaffecting the issuer's treasury.

The **`pay()` function** calculates the current average selling price of a Rolling SAFE token. The `pay()` function is called to send funds to the issuer via the smart contract and send the correct amount of tokens to investors in return as the function also triggers the issuance of new tokens. The funds are transferred to the issuer but a part of it is retained by the smart contract and used to issue new tokens, which are sent to the issuer or the investor. Calling the `pay()` function leads to an increase in the cash reserve of the smart contract, which leads to an increased value of tokens.

The **`buy()` function** calculates the average price of a Rolling SAFE token in the base currency. Technically, the `buy()` function is called to send base currency to the issuer via the smart contract, which then issues new tokens in relation to the investment amount that is sent to the issuer. All funds are transferred using the smart contract's cash reserve. When an investor sends funds in base currency to the smart contract (i.e. the DAT receives a payment), a portion of the funds is sent to the **cash reserve** managed by the contract and another part goes into the **issuers/companies wallet**.

The **`burn()` function** assists with "burning" tokens, i.e. taking them out of circulation. This does not technically destroy tokens, but as they become unusable the marginal value of the tokens (the lowest value of the burnt tokens) is redistributed among the remaining tokenholders via the `sell()` function. As burning tokens does technically not destroy them, the total amount of tokens issued is not affected. Thus, burning tokens can be used to influence the sell price but not the buy price.

<HighlightBox type="info">

In blockchain, coin or token burning is not an unusual thing. Burning is done to take tokens out of circulation. Often this happens by sending a token intentionally to an unusable wallet address (burn address). The address is unusable because it cannot be accessed by or assigned to anyone.

This is the case when working with tez. Since in the TZMINT web application the issuer mints its tokens, there is no need for a burn address.

</HighlightBox>

The Rolling SAFE's issuing organization can use the `burn()` function to either burn tokens that are not being used or more importantly, burn tokens to increase the overall value of all tokens. The latter takes place because when a token is burnt its value is redistributed to all tokenholders. When a tokenholder sells tokens, it receives apart from the cash reserve equal to the number of tokens being sold and on top, a portion of the value of burnt tokens is also allocated to the selling tokenholder. Therefore, the issuer can influence the sell price with the `burn()` function. The sell price is not affected as the total amount of issued tokens remains the same regardless of the burning of tokens. Through this mechanism value is never locked in the cash reserve; when all tokens are bought back by the issuer, the complete funds held by the cash reserve are depleted.

## Fixed dilution

In Rolling SAFEs, fixed dilution is ensured with the fixed retained revenue percentage dedicated to the reserve. Unlike a traditional additional issuance of shares, the token issuance and their value is fixed by the parameters of the offering's smart contract. The value an investor holds is not reduced by the issuance of further tokens. There is no dilution from equity financing. This reduces the risk for an investor and makes dilutions a fixed and pre-determined factor.

Independently of the equity raised by the issuer, all investor claims remain collectively the same. There is a certain degree of dilution each investor has to live with due to each token issuance contributing to dilution. The dilution remains predictable and therefore, reduces the amount of unknown and uncalculated risk from equity dilutions known from other financial instruments.
