The wrapper are used to fetch contract and transaction data and to call the contract:

- `chainWrapper`: uses TzKT API to fetch blockchain data and formats, cashes and calculates values,
- `walletWrapper`: uses BeaconSDK to sign the transactions,
- `contractWrapper`: uses `walletWrapper` to sign the transactions and Taquito to send transactions to the Tezos Node.

The component that brings the platform and the Tezos blockchain together is the `DataHandler`. It requests the data the platform needs with `chainWrapper` and it uses the `contractWrapper` to buy and sell tokens.
