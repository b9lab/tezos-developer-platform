The TZMINT web application platform is an example project and part of this educational course. There is **no real investment or company** involved. The TZM tokenss do not represent claims to a real investment but are only issued as part of an educational project; they do not hold any value. Instead, all transactions displayed are performed on a Tezos testnet, the Hangzhou Testnet.

The following step-by-step get started instructions help you set up everything you need to buy and sell TZM tokens on trhough the web application. These tokens do not represent claims to a real investment but are only issued as part of an educational project - They do not hold any value.

## Signing-in

To sign in, please:

1. Go to [https://tzmint.b9lab.com/](https://tzmint.b9lab.com/), and
2. Click on the `Sign in` button in the top right corner.

You can now choose between **two ways to sign in**:

* With your email, or

To **sign in with your email**, type in your email address into the field and click on `Sign in with Email`. You will receive a sign-in link to your email address.
Just click on the `Sign in` button in the email and you will be redirected to the web application.

To **sign in with your Google account**, click on the button labeled `Sign in with Google`. This will redirect you to the Google account login.

Once you logged in, your web application account information will appear under the `My Profile` tab.

Now, you have an account on the platform! We still need to connect your wallet for you to be able to buy and sell TZM tokens.

## Connecting my wallet

As soon as you are logged in, the platform will ask you to connect your wallet. While you have not connected a wallet, a pop-up will appear asking you to select your preferred wallet every time you navigate to the `Profile` section.

You have to decide whether you want to **pair your wallet on the same device or another device**.

To pair your wallet on an **external device**, just click on the button `Pair wallet on another device`, a QR code becomes visible. Scan the QR code with a Beacon-compatible wallet and you are set.

For pairing with the **same device**, you can either connect your wallet through a browser extension or connect the platform to either desktop and web wallets, or mobile wallets.

You can choose between:

* [Spire](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spire/gpfndedineagiepkpinficbcbbgjoenn?hl=en) and [Temple Wallet](https://templewallet.com/) - if you want to connect through a browser extension,
* [Galleon](https://cryptonomic.tech/galleon.html), [Kukai Wallet](https://wallet.kukai.app/), or [Umami](https://umamiwallet.com/) - if you want to connect a desktop or web wallet, and
* [AirGap Wallet](https://airgap.it/) - if you want to connect through a mobile wallet.

### Connecting your Temple Wallet

In case you want to use the Temple Wallet, this is your road to success:

1. Install the **Temple Wallet extension** for your browser. If your using Google Chrome, just go to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/temple-tezos-wallet-ex-th/ookjlbkiijinhpmnjffcofjonbfbgaoc?hl=en) and add the extension for Temple.
2. Once the extension is added, Temple will ask you whether you want to **create a new wallet** - in case you do not have a wallet yet - **or import your existing wallet**.

Go to your Temple extension. It should be set by default to the Mainnet, but you want the **Hangzhou Testnet** for this application.
