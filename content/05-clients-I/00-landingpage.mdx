<OverviewBox title="Let’s take a closer look at developing clients for Tezos!" imgSrc="/img/Feature_3-01.png" floating="true">

In this chapter, we will deal with clients: How can we fetch information from the Tezos blockchain? There are different ways to fetch data, create and send transactions, and work with different tech stacks.

We will dive into Taquito and TzKT API to understand:
* What Taquito is,
* How to fetch information from the Tezos blockchain with Taquito,
* How to create and send transactions using Taquito,
* How to code a simple client,
* What TzKT API is, and
* How to fetch information with the TzkT API.

<OverviewBox title="In this chapter" imgSrc="/img/reclining-person.svg" floating="true">

We now have an overview of the Tezos protocol, its architecture, its functionalities, and smart contract writing for Tezos in Michelson, SmartPy, and LIGO. It is time to turn to clients. How can we setup a client and use tech stack to fetch information from the Tezos blockchain and conduct transactions?

We will apply our knowledge to our smart contract to certify students."></ActionCard>
<ActionCard href="/tzkt" text="LIGO - Writing Smart Contracts" desc="We will tackle smart contract development with CameLIGO with an introduction to LIGO, and a closer look at CameLIGO, managing storage, and PascaLIGO. This section also includes an introduction to OCaml. To fortify what we learned, we will apply our knowledge to our smart contract to certify students."></ActionCard>
