<OverviewBox title="Letâ€™s take a closer look at developing clients for Tezos!" imgSrc="/img/Feature_3-01.png" floating="true">

In this chapter, we will deal with clients: How can we fetch information from the Tezos blockchain and how can we create and send transactions to the network?

We will dive into Taquito and TzKT API to understand:
* What Taquito is,
* How to fetch information from the Tezos blockchain with Taquito,
* How to create and send transactions using Taquito,
* How to code a simple client,
* What TzKT API is, and
* How to fetch information with the TzkT API.

<OverviewBox title="In this chapter" imgSrc="/img/reclining-person.svg" floating="true">

We now have an overview of the Tezos protocol, its architecture, its functionalities, and smart contract writing for Tezos in Michelson, SmartPy, and LIGO. It is time to turn to clients. How can we setup a client and use tech stack to fetch information from the Tezos blockchain and conduct transactions?
