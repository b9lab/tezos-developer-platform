It is time to also get to know Tezos’ ecosystem! In this chapter, you can find an overview of working with some of the ecosystem stack: FA2, oracles, and Beacon.

You can find information on:
* What the FA2 token standard is,
* Different permissions implementation patterns, entry points, and data structures in regard to FA2, 
* How to use the FA2 interface for Tezos,
* Work with Harbinger and Chainlink,
* How the Beacon SDK helps support wallet-application integration.

It’s all about the ecosystem! A blockchain protocol offering a wide and evolving ecosystem is a great choice for a blockchain developer to build on. The Tezos ecosystem provides possibilities to use a unified token contract interface.
