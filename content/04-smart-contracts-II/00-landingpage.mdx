<OverviewBox title="Can you really get enough of smart contracts?" imgSrc="/img/Feature_6_A-01.png" floating="true">

In this chapter, we are continuing with smart contracts. Let’s shift our attention away from SmartPy and take a closer look at Michelson and LIGO.

Let’s dive into:
* The smart contract language Michelson, its core and domain specific data types, stack operations, and operations on strings
* The high-level language LIGO,
* CameLIGO, our repeater contract, and how to handle storage, and
* Writing smart contracts with PascaLIGO.

Now, we will dive deeper into smart contract writing and deployment through taking a look at Michelson and LIGO. We will introduce the languages, their basics, and how they can be applied to previous smart contract examples.

We will apply our knowledge to our smart contract to certify students."></ActionCard>
