# Truffle

As we have seen, preparing and deploying contracts can be slow and painful. We need a tool with a faster turn around time. ConsenSys's [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) is such a tool. It was first introduced for the Ethereum protocol but it supports now different protocols.
Truffle will compile your contracts and deploy them on the Tezos node of your choice.

## Install

Let us start by installing Truffle for Tezos. 

```bash
$ npm install -g truffle@tezos
```

This will [globally](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-globally) install Truffle for Tezos on your system. 

## Verify

Ensure that it is properly installed:

```bash
$ truffle
Truffle v5.5.0-tezos.4 - the most popular blockchain development framework

Usage: truffle <command> [options]

Commands:
  build     Execute build pipeline (if configuration present)

...

$ truffle version

Truffle v5.5.0-tezos.4 (core: 5.5.0-tezos.4)
Solidity v0.5.16 (solc-js)
Node v14.11.0
Web3.js v1.2.1
```

Notice, that your version may differ from the one above.

## A ready-made project

Tezos offers a sample project for Tezos: [Tezos Truffle Box](https://github.com/truffle-box/tezos-example-box)

Let us use it for a quick start. Create a folder for this sample and run in it:

```bash
truffle unbox tezos-example
```

## File structure

When you invoke `truffle unbox tezos-example`, Truffle will create the following:

- folder contracts/, where you save your contracts written in LIGO
- folder test/, where you place your tests written in Javascript
- folder migrations/, where you define the ordered set of scripts that build, and update, your system
- file truffle.js truffle-config.js, where Truffle is directed as to what to do

After you have built further, your will get a build folder with the compiled output of your contracts.

Have a look at the contracts in the `contracts` folder, they are written in PascalLIGO.

In the `truffle-config.js` you can see:

```javascript
const { alice } = require('./scripts/sandbox/accounts');

module.exports = {
  // see <http://truffleframework.com/docs/advanced/configuration>
  // for more details on how to specify configuration options!
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "http://localhost",
      port: 8732,
      network_id: "*",
      secretKey: alice.sk,
      type: "tezos"
    },
    carthagenet: {
      host: "https://carthagenet.smartpy.io",
      port: 443,
      network_id: "*",
      type: "tezos"
    },
    mainnet: {
      host: "https://mainnet.smartpy.io",
      port: 443,
      network_id: "*",
      type: "tezos"
    },
    zeronet: {
      host: "https://zeronet.smartpy.io",
      port: 443,
      network_id: "*",
      type: "tezos"
    }
  }
};
```

and in the `accounts.js` :

```javascript
module.exports = {
    alice: {
        pkh: "tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb",
        sk: "edsk3QoqBuvdamxouPhin7swCvkQNgq4jP5KZPbwWNnwdZpSpJiEbq",
        pk: "edpkvGfYw3LyB1UcCahKQk4rF2tvbMUk8GFiTuMjL75uGXrpvKXhjn"
    },
    bob: {
        pkh: "tz1aSkwEot3L2kmUvcoxzjMomb9mvBNuzFK6",
        sk: "edsk3RFfvaFaxbHx8BMtEW1rKQcPtDML3LXjNqMNLCzC3wLC1bWbAt",
        pk: "edpkurPsQ8eUApnLUJ9ZPDvu98E8VNj4KtJa1aZr16Cr5ow5VHKnz4"
    }
};
```

so we can work with the [sandbox environment](https://github.com/truffle-box/tezos-example-box#sandbox-management). 

Make sure that you local node is not listening at port 8732 and run:

```bash
$ npm run start-sandbox
```

in the sample folder. This will start a testing environment.

Now let us [migrate](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/tezos/truffle/getting-started/deploying-tezos-contracts) the sample contracts:

```bash
$ truffle migrate

Let us run the tests:

```bash
truffle test
Using network 'development'.


Compiling your contracts...
===========================
> Everything is up to date, there is nothing to compile.



  Contract: Counter
    ✓ ...should increment storage by 5. (1138ms)
    ✓ ...should decrement storage by 2. (1217ms)

  Contract: SimpleStorage
    1) ...should store the integer 89.


  2 passing (8s)
  1 failing

  1) Contract: SimpleStorage
       ...should store the integer 89.:
     TypeError: simpleStorageInstance.default is not a function
      at Context.<anonymous> (test/simpleStorage.test.js:6:40)
      at runMicrotasks (<anonymous>)
      at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:93:5)
```

Oh we have a problem with the `SimpleStorage` test. This is the right time to have a look into the test:

```javascript
const SimpleStorage = artifacts.require("SimpleStorage");

contract("SimpleStorage", () => {
  it("...should store the integer 89.", async () => {
    const simpleStorageInstance = await SimpleStorage.deployed();
    await simpleStorageInstance.default(89);
    const storedInt = await simpleStorageInstance.storage();

    assert.equal(storedInt, 89, "The integer 89 was not stored.");
  });
});
```

We see that it calls `simpleStorageInstance.default(89)` to store the value `89`. As you can expect `default` entrypoint of the `simpleStorage`contract will be `main`, which we can call directly. So change the regarding line into:

```javascript
    await simpleStorageInstance.main(89);
```

to fix the test. You can run the test for `simpleStorage` separately: 

```bash
$ truffle test test/simpleStorage.test.js 
```

The unit-test facility in Truffle is built on top of Mocha. So if you are fluent with it, things will look in order. If you are not, you can look up Mocha at any time.

If you are not familiar with the concept of unit-tests, this [primer](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/unit-testing) is as good as any.

<div class "b9-tip">
Tests do not interfere with your instances deployed via truffle migrate. Yes, tests use the same migrations/* files, but precisely to deploy new instances.

It is good practice for your tests to check that these migration files deployed instances as expected. On the other hand, it is bad practice to use these instances for the rest of the tests. For that, the best practice is to deploy a new instance in a `beforeEach` block.
</div>

# Structure of Javascript tests
You can have as many test files as needed. Each test file can have as many tests as needed. Test files are structured in the following way.

First, you need to import the contracts you are going to test, with for instance:

```javascript
const SimpleStorage = artifacts.require("SimpleStorage");
```

The artifacts object here is already injected by Truffle test and allows you to quickly instantiate the truffle-contract factory of your contract. In this case, `const SimpleStorage` is the factory.

Then, for the testing proper, a `contract()` method takes:

- a string that helps you identify what you are testing; this string will be repeated for every test inside it.
- a callback function that receives the list of accounts of the node client it connects to.

<div class="b9-tip">
You can still use `describe()` to run normal Mocha tests.
</div>

## The console

Let us see how we can interact with the contracts.

Run:

```bash
$ truffle console
truffle(development)> 
```

Here, we are in, wait for it, the Truffle console. It is a similar Javascript environment and provides some auto-completion with the **TAB** key. We can basically do some testing in a more interactive way:

```javascript
truffle(development)> const simpleStorageInstance = await SimpleStorage.deployed()
undefined
```

Also note how the Truffle console tells you ´truffle(development)´. This development is in relation to how you launched the console. It is not in relation to the node you connected to.

let us have a look into `simpleStorageInstance`:

```javascript
truffle(development)> simpleStorageInstance
TruffleContract {
  constructor: [Function: TruffleContract] {
    _constructorMethods: {
      ...
    },
    _properties: {
      contract_name: [Object],
      contractName: [Object],
      ...
    },
    _property_values: {},
    _json: {
      contractName: 'SimpleStorage',
      abi: [],
      metadata: undefined,
      initialStorage: undefined,
      michelson: '[ { "prim": "parameter", "args": [ { "prim": "int" } ] },\n' +
        '  { "prim": "storage", "args": [ { "prim": "int" } ] },\n' +
        '  { "prim": "code",\n' +
        '    "args":\n' +
        '      [ [ { "prim": "UNPAIR" }, { "prim": "SWAP" }, { "prim": "DROP" },\n' +
        '          { "prim": "NIL", "args": [ { "prim": "operation" } ] },\n' +
        '          { "prim": "PAIR" } ] ] } ]',
        ...
    },
    ...,
    interfaceAdapter: TezosAdapter { tezos: [TezosToolkit] },
    currentProvider: HttpProvider {
      host: 'http://localhost:8732',
      httpAgent: [Agent],
      timeout: 0,
      headers: undefined,
      connected: false,
      send: [Function (anonymous)],
      _alreadyWrapped: true
    },
    network_id: 'NetXeb52sbbRG2V',
    ens: { enabled: false, registryAddress: null }
  },
  methods: {},
  abi: [],
  transactionHash: 'opG43Mm9jybeTThTT8k4fZpRJmgSLEr6p9U6AaSeqcXj8aiin4o',
  contract: ContractAbstraction {
    address: 'KT1MzcNGVYbZiD5thUDoznZM87K15YNT8cJv',
    script: { code: [Array], storage: [Object] },
    storageProvider: RpcContractProvider {
      context: [Context],
      estimator: [RPCEstimateProvider]
    },
    entrypoints: { entrypoints: {} },
    methods: { main: [Function: method] },
    schema: Schema {
      root: [IntToken],
      [Symbol(taquito-schema-type-symbol)]: true
    },
    parameterSchema: ParameterSchema { root: [IntToken] },
    transactionHash: 'opG43Mm9jybeTThTT8k4fZpRJmgSLEr6p9U6AaSeqcXj8aiin4o'
  },
  address: 'KT1MzcNGVYbZiD5thUDoznZM87K15YNT8cJv',
  main: [Function (anonymous)] { sendTransaction: [Function (anonymous)] },
  storage: [Function (anonymous)],
  send: [AsyncFunction (anonymous)],
  sendTransaction: [Function (anonymous)] { sendTransaction: [Function (anonymous)] }
}
```

There is a lot of information. You will find the Michelson code of the **repeater** contract which does the same as the `SimpleStorage` contract in the Tezos Truffle Box. In addition you can see the `methods` we can call. Let us first fetch the storage:

```javascript
truffle(development)> await simpleStorageInstance.storage()
3
```

Now let us change this value:

```javascript
truffle(development)> await simpleStorageInstance.main(90)
{
  tx: 'opPoUD9HWv4JtayXBPH79S5BaT145aDCBhSevuXEmdZ4LZo9i5G',
  receipt: TransactionOperation {
    hash: 'opPoUD9HWv4JtayXBPH79S5BaT145aDCBhSevuXEmdZ4LZo9i5G',
    raw: {
      opbytes: 'f84f22910b212c27df75676cea4acd11bfa779e8b41370a73c8c1bf45e803f3e6c006b82198cb179e8306c1bedd08f12dc863f328886b1043aea14000001931bf0a2274922df215008beaa2c457385a6a4d800ff0000000003009a011cacd4767133167957201ce01ea940dd2db8654ad4228df04b9244cc51bdefbe114834c2ad0201f6684fe25e736dd3f3834650e01c2801ddc40b5ddf00316b0a',

      _walletProvider: [LegacyWalletProvider]
    },
    '_pollingConfig$': ReplaySubject {
      _isScalar: false,
      observers: [],
      closed: false,

    },
    _currentHeadPromise: Promise { [Object] },
    'currentHead$': Observable { _isScalar: false, _subscribe: [Function (anonymous)] },
    'polling$': Observable { _isScalar: false, _subscribe: [Function (anonymous)] },
    'confirmed$': Observable {
      _isScalar: false,
      source: [Observable],
      operator: [Function: shareReplayOperation]
    },
    _foundAt: 60,
    params: {
      kind: 'transaction',
      fee: 561,

      storage_limit: 0,
      amount: '0',
      destination: 'KT1MzcNGVYbZiD5thUDoznZM87K15YNT8cJv',
      parameters: [Object]
    },
    source: 'tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb'
  }
}
```

and check the value again:

```
truffle(development)> await simpleStorageInstance.storage()
90
```

## Test Certification

We now have a test suit for our certification smart contract in LIGO:

```Pascal
type student is record
    name : string ;
    certificate : bool;
end
type certStorage is record
  students : list(student);
  certifier : address;
end

function main (const studentName : string; const oldState:certStorage) : (list(operation) * certStorage) is
  begin
  if sender =/= oldState.certifier then failwith("Only certifier can call this function");
  else skip;
  const newStudent : student = record 
            name = studentName; 
            certificate= True;
            end;
  const oldList:list(student) = oldState.students;
  const newList:list(student) = cons(newStudent, oldList);
  const newState : certStorage = record
            students= newList;
            certifier= oldState.certifier;
            end;
  end with ((nil : list(operation)), newState)
  ```

you can create a project with:

```bash
$ truffle init
```

and save the students contract as `students.ligo` in the `contracts` folder of the initiated project. You will also see the migrations contract which keeps the record of the successfull compilations.

Now try to compile the contract:

```
$ truffle compile

Compiling your contracts...
===========================
> Compiling ./contracts/Migrations.ligo
> Compiling ./contracts/students.ligo
> Using entry point "main"
> Artifacts written to /Users/muratoener/Desktop/Tezos/trufflestd/build/contracts
> Compiled successfully using:
   - ligo: next
```

We need a script to deploy the contract:

```javascript
const Students = artifacts.require("Students");

module.exports = deployer => {
  deployer.deploy(Students, {students : [], certifier: "tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb"});
};
```

you can save this as `2_deploy_students.js` in the `migrations` folder. We use as certifier Alice's key from the `accounts.js`.

Now we can write a simple test:

```javascript
const Students = artifacts.require("Students");

contract("Students", () => {
    it("...should certify Mike", async () => {
        const StudentsInstance = await Students.deployed();
        await StudentsInstance.main("Mike");
        const storage = await StudentsInstance.storage();

        assert.deepEqual(storage, {
                students: [{
                    certificate: true,
                    name: "Mike"
                }],
                certifier: "tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb"
            },
            "The integer 89 was not stored.");
    });
});
```

<div class="b9-tip">
Add another test with another key and see if you can certify a student
</div>
