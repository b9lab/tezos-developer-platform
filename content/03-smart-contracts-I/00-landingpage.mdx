What can we expect in this chapter? Now that we have a good overview of Tezos, we will address smart contracts. SmartPy allows you to write smart contracts without the need to learn a smart contract-specific language as it is available through a Python library.

We will take a look at:
* How to use the Python library of SmartPy,
* How to work with the SmartPy online editor,
* How to write a repeater contract with SmartPy and manage multiple inputs,
* How typing and conditions work with SmartPy,
* How to write and deploy a smart contract to certify students,
* How to write and deploy a smart contract for crowdfunding.

This time it is all about smart contracts! We will begin our Tezos’ smart contract journey with an introduction to SmartPy, including a quick Python refresher. After, we will dive into the language and apply what we learned to two smart contract examples: A contract to certify students and a contract for crowdfunding.
