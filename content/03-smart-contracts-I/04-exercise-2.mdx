Now that we tested a more complicated storage structure, let's dive into another example.

Does [crowdfunding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdfunding) sound familiar to you?

The topic is very interesting because there are many forms in which to conduct crowdfunding. The basic idea is to finance a project or enterprise **through the contributions of many**, i.e. "the crowd", instead of convincing a closed group of traditional financing institutions (i.e. banks, venture capital funds, investment firms, etc.) to provide capital for a project.

We want to explore the possibilities of a **decentralised crowdfunding approach**.

For this, a public blockchain like Tezos is well-fitted. The openness of a public blockchain platform should be suitable as crowdfunding is in its nature an **open, transparent, and public form of financing**. The main idea is that a project initiator, i.e. the founder, is able to kick off a crowdfund with just a few clicks.

## The crowdfunding smart contract

Each project will be represented by an individual Tezos smart contract. The smart contract has to fulfil **three functions**:

* **sendFund**: Every user with a Tezos address can use this function to participate in the crowdfund. For reasons of simplicity, each address can only make **one payment**;
* **payOff**: The project initiator can transfer the collected funds to a different address. This can only be done if the **funding target is met**. For reasons of simplicity, the owner can call this function only after the deadline has passed; and
* **refund**: In case the set funding goal is not met in a specified time frame, each participant can request a refund.

Moreover, the **storage** has to contain the following **information**:

* **minAmount**: This is the minimum limit to be achieved for a crowdfund to be considered successful; and
* **maxTime**: This value represents the deadline by which the **minAmount** has to be met.

Surely, you already have some ideas for the smart contract, and maybe you also started seeing possible difficulties and stumbling blocks.

Let's take a **test-driven** development approach.

So, we start with the test ensuring a functioning smart contracts fulfilling the requirements as specified before.

```python
@sp.add_test(name = "successful Crowdfunding")
def successful():

    # dummy addresses
    owner= sp.address("tz1xowner")
    user1= sp.address("tz1xuser1")
    user2= sp.address("tz1xuser2")
    user3= sp.address("tz1xuser3")

    # minAmonut= 20
    # deadline= now + 3d
    contract = Crowdfunding(owner, 
    sp.tez(20), sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+259200))
    scenario = sp.test_scenario()
    scenario+= contract

    scenario+= contract.sendFund().run(sender=user1, 
    amount=sp.tez(10), now = sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+100))

    scenario+= contract.sendFund().run(sender=user2, 
    amount=sp.tez(8), now = sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+200))

    # will fail because user1 already sent
    scenario += contract.sendFund().run(sender=user1, 
    amount=sp.tez(12), now = sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+300), valid = False)

    # will fail because 2 tez missing
    scenario += contract.payOff().run(sender=owner, 
    now = sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+300), valid = False)

    scenario += contract.sendFund().run(sender=user3, 
    amount=sp.tez(15), now = sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+400))

    # will fail because deadline not reached
    scenario += contract.payOff().run(sender=owner, 
    now = sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+500), valid = False)

    scenario += contract.payOff().run(sender=owner, 
    now = sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+259200))
```

Now that we have a test, next is the contract:

```python
import time
import smartpy as sp

class Crowdfunding(sp.Contract):
    def __init__(self, owner, minAmount, maxTime):
        self.init(funding=sp.map(tkey=sp.TAddress, tvalue=None), owner=owner, minAmount=minAmount, maxTime=maxTime)

    @sp.entry_point
    def sendFund(self, params):
        sp.verify(self.data.maxTime >= sp.now) 
        sp.verify(~self.data.funding.contains(sp.sender))
        self.data.funding[sp.sender]= sp.amount

    @sp.entry_point
    def payOff(self, params):
        sp.verify(self.data.owner==sp.sender)
        sp.verify(self.data.minAmount <= sp.balance)
        sp.verify(self.data.maxTime <= sp.now)
        sp.send(self.data.owner, sp.balance)

    @sp.entry_point
    def refund(self, params):
        sp.verify(self.data.funding.contains(sp.sender))
        sp.verify(self.data.maxTime < sp.now)
        sp.verify(self.data.minAmount > sp.balance)
        sp.send(sp.sender, self.data.funding[sp.sender])
        del self.data.funding[sp.sender]

@sp.add_test(name = "successful Crowdfunding")
def successful():

    # dummy addresses
    owner= sp.address("tz1xowner")
    user1= sp.address("tz1xuser1")
    user2= sp.address("tz1xuser2")
    user3= sp.address("tz1xuser3")

    # minAmonut= 20
    # deadline= now + 3d
    contract = Crowdfunding(owner, 
    sp.tez(20), sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+259200))
    scenario = sp.test_scenario()
    scenario+= contract
    scenario+= contract.sendFund().run(sender=user1, 
    amount=sp.tez(10), now = sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+100))
    scenario+= contract.sendFund().run(sender=user2, 
    amount=sp.tez(8), now = sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+200))

    # will fail because user1 already sent
    scenario += contract.sendFund().run(sender=user1, 
    amount=sp.tez(12), now = sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+300), valid = False)

    # will fail because 2 tez missing
    scenario += contract.payOff().run(sender=owner, 
    now = sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+300), valid = False)
    scenario += contract.sendFund().run(sender=user3, 
    amount=sp.tez(15), now = sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+400))

    # will fail because deadline not reached
    scenario += contract.payOff().run(sender=owner, 
    now = sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+500), valid = False)
    scenario += contract.payOff().run(sender=owner, 
    now = sp.timestamp(int(time.time())+259200))
```

Thus, the smart contract allows:

* A user with a Tezos address to send funds - Remember, a payment can only be made once;
* To transfer the collected funds to a different address of the initiator once the funding target is met;
* The crowdfunding participants to request a refund, if the funding target isn't met;
* For the storage to contain the **minAmount** and **maxTime**.
